1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it’s unobserved it will, however, if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Agreed, what’s your point?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"There’s no point, I just think it’s a good idea for a tee-shirt."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Excuse me?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s Port-au-Prince. Haiti."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I think this is the place.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t think I can do this."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I’m sure she’ll still love him.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I wouldn’t.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Well, what do you want to do?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I want to leave.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Okay.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,What’s the protocol for leaving?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Let’s try just walking out.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Okay.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Bye-bye
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,See you.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,No.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Not really.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"No, it’s true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,New neighbour?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Evidently.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Leonard, Sheldon."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Oh, great."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Great.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Great. Well, bye."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Bye.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Bye.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,No. We’re going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Not with commentary.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Yes, and you’ve never met one of them."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That’s the beauty of it.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice meal and chat.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Chat? We don’t chat. At least not offline.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,To what end?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Hi. Again.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Hi.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Uh, yes."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Great.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Okay, well, make yourself at home."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,You’re very welcome.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Actually that’s my work.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Yeah.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,What?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"I didn’t invent them, they’re there."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,In what universe?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"In all of them, that is the point."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Um, Penny, that’s where I sit."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"No, I sit there."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Here we go.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Well.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, sit!"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Aaah!
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Yes I now, but…"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Yes, I remember."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I resent you saying we don’t have company.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I’m sorry.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I said I’m sorry.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,You’re lactose intolerant.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,So it’s based on your life?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Don’t.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"You? No, you’ll only make it worse."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Yes.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Our shower works.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Yes.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,No.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,No?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,No.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,No.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,It’s right down the hall.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,How so?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Excuse me?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Yes, but not of the same species."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Oh, of course."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,See what?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,This is not a good time.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"That’s great, you guys have to go."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,It’s just not a good time.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Uh-huh.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I’m not anticipating coitus.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Can we please stop saying coitus?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Save it for your blog, Howard."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll…."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,The hair products are Sheldon’s.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Oh, I’ll probably say yes."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Wow.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Must we?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Which is?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,You think with your penis.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,No I don’t. And neither do you.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,So we get to have a scene with him?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Hello.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Okay, thanks for your time."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,We’re not going to give up just like that.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,My apologies. What’s your plan.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,What do you think their combined IQ is?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Just grab the door.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,From the intercom.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Oh. We’re scientists.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Tell him about our IQ.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Leonard.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,What?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,My mom bought me those pants.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,I’m sorry.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,You’re going to have to call her.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Well you got me out of my pants.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,We’re home.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,"No, it was a valid hypothesis."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Really? Great.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?"
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,Not to mention imaginary.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Leonard,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,They’re both curry based cuisines.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
1,1,Pilot Episode,Sheldon,"I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Here we go.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on the door.) I’ll get it."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"They’re not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in hallway.) So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Yes.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Hi.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, no problem."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Penny, wait."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We’re locked out.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,I hardly think so.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Why not?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter… (starts to move package) I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Archimedes would be so proud.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Do you have any ideas?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Exactly half.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,What’s your formula for the corner.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Men do things for women without expecting sex.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yeah, those are men who just had sex."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,You okay?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, it hurt… (looking around) Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,So Penny’s a little messy.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, we should go."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Hang on.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,What are you doing?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Straightening up.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not your home."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,What were you doing in his closet?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,I helped run some cable for a webcam.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,(sucks in breath)
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,No?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, we’ll get out of your hair."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,It’s a joke.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, he didn’t tell it right."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon? Hello?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Sheldon!
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to get out of here."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,You might want to speak in a lower register.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,What?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,That’s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that’s ridiculous."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,I am not leaving until I’m done.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Morning.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Morning.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,You think?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,You don’t think that crosses a line?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,You have a sarcasm sign?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, I do not have a sarcasm sign."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Penny’s up.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,How did she know it was us?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"God, this is going to be bad."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, but, only to clean."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"I’m very, very sorry."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”) Oh!"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Sure, that’s another way to go."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What’s funny?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,That wasn’t sarcasm?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,No.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny’s door.) I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,It’s fine. You win.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Oh.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Um, here’s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research…."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Yeah.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Six two inch dowels.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Check.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"One package, Phillips head screws."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Check.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,Considering what? How great this place looks?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,What?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,We could put her stereo back there.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,And control it how?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Also inefficient, and might be loud."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink."
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Meet back here in an hour?
1,2,The Big Bran Hypothesis,Leonard,Got it. (They all leave).
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Good lord!
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Lock and load.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Stay in formation.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,I’ve got the Sword of Azeroth!
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Dammit man, we’re dying here."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Goodbye, peasants."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,The bastard teleported.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You betrayed us for money, who are you?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"I’m a rogue knight elf, don’t you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Wooh, I’m all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right now."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Excuse me.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Don’t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you’d have an excuse to talk to her.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, right, right right right right."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Not much. Bro.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! (Returns to apartment)."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Penny for your thoughts.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is really fine and…"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,What is wrong with you?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Please don’t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don’t crash into geek mountain again."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Yeah.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,So?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Hello Lesley.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don’t need to quibble over terminology."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You mean, kiss you now?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,None?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Ah. Well, thank you for your time."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,None at all?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I’m a robot, would I be bound by Asimov’s three laws of robotics?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Of course not.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Well, no."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,The internet’s been down for half an hour.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don’t know if I can take it."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, good lord."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"If you’re compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. (Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag) Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Leonard, listen to me…"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the woman rejected me."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask her out."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don’t buy a cat."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, but you’re right. I should march over there and ask her out."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Really? Great!
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Us guys?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Great. Did we say a time?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,And that’s still good for you.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Cos it’s not carved in stone.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I’ll get my chisel.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,How do I look?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Could you be more specific?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Six thirty.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Is it too much?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Not if you’re a rugby team.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Why would I join you?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such a good idea."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, there’s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Of course, there’s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"If I could of, I would of."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Is the sex starting now?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I’m having a panic attack.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Why?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Just do it.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Okay.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,What?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"It’s a bio-feedback technique, it’s relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Me?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Yes.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,What should I tell her.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Okay.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Got it. So I’m assuming nothing venereal. I’ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven’t quite bounced back.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Give me the phone.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Why would she be expecting me?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,We both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Nothing.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, (waves her away) You were saying, but…"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll get her back.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Well, chafing, right?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears under table.)Now, if you were riding on the olive, you’d be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would (he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,I’m not okay.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Yes, but I get car sick too, so…"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"Sorry about your car, by the way."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Yeah.
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,"When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a while, good night."
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,"So, how was your date?"
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Leonard,Awesome!
1,3,The Fuzzy Boots Corollary,Sheldon,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about time travel again.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Interesting.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Yeah, it really takes the pressure off."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Then I guess congratulations are in order.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"I know, I’m familiar with you."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Yes, I was there."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,What?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Nothing.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Mahalo’s a nice touch.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Interesting, you should lead with that."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,You don’t have buffets in India?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Well here’s an interesting turn of events.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I can’t believe he fired me.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Morning
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Morning.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,You’re making eggs for breakfast?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,As do I.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,And we all thank you.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Slow down. Slow down, please slow down."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Isn’t it?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Well then you’ll want some manganese.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,What’s with the fish?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,It’s an experiment.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,What happened to your scrambled egg research?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,So… fish.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Fish nightlights.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Like luminous fish.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Shhhhh!
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Right… I didn’t….
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Thank you for coming on such short notice.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Thank you.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I know, but why?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Really, when was the last time you left the house."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I went to the market with Penny.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,That was three weeks ago.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Where are you going?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"To my room, and no-one’s allowed in."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Oh.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,I see.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Sounds like a wise man.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,A death ray?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Morning.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"What do you want, mom?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Yeah.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,What for?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,No.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Why not?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Really? That’s impressive.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Dr Gablehouser.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out."
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,"Hey, how did it go?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I got my job back.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,Really? What happened?
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Leonard,That narrows it down.
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,"Thanks, mom. Mom?"
1,4,The Luminous Fish Effect,Sheldon,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,And Orcs!
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Statistically unlikely.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the hamburgers here."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Make it two.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Hey Lesley.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Lesley and I do research together at the University.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,What happened to Elliot Wong?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, sure, why not."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Why at my place?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"You’re a lucky man, Leonard."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,How so?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Well, what do you think."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Thank you.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Uh, sure, why not."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Really?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,I thought you weren’t interested in me.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,You mean my cello?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,No kidding?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Gee, uh…"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Penny? What about her?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in bringing it up."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"I’m good, I’m good to go."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Just come with me.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Well?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,What does it mean?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Yes, but I was eleven."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Well, there’s Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"No, no, wait, hold on."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Are you sure?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,You did this?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Cool?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Thank you, I’ll see you at work."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Who told you you could touch my board?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,I don’t come into your house and touch your board.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Oh, that is so… so…"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Pretty good.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Sheldon!
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,I’m coming.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go!"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,She’s not that intelligent.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,She fixed your equation.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,She got lucky.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,You don’t believe in luck.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Leonard?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Yeah.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,I still don’t care.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Hey, Lesley."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how the banana felt."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Who wouldn’t?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,You want to make plans for New Years.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Doctor what?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Wha… how did it get on the internet?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Well, how did you know about it?"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Well, that part’s true!"
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,No kidding.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Really?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can’t grow soup."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work out."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Sheldon,"Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
1,5,The Hamburger Postulate,Leonard,"Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. (Sheldon nods)."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"I was giving clear, concise orders."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Hello Penny.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,A party?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Dancing?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"The thing is, we’re not…."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,We’re really more….
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,No.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,A Halloween party?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Is there a theme?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy…"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,What about comic-books?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Anime?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods…"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, no."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"We all have other costumes, we can change."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,I call Frodo!
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,You went with Thor?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"No, it’s not…"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, sorry we’re late."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,And you said the party starts at seven.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,It’s 7:05.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,So what time does the costume parade start?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,This party is just going to suck.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Okay.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"See, people get it."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,We’re socialising. Meeting new people.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Telepathically?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Where do you get this stuff?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, I actually might be able to help."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,How so?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Go on.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Then what happens?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,That’s as far as I’ve gotten.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Good luck.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"No, you’re coming with me."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Come on.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Yes. But I need a wing-man.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Hi.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Hello.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Neeeeeooooowwwwww!
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,I’m the Doppler Effect.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Because I’m Frodo.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Oh no.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,What?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug)."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,You have a back-up hypothesis.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Maybe they just want to be friends.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Then he and I are on equal ground.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Yet another child left behind.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"No, I’m a Hobbit."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,I’m not. No offence.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"If he understands that, you’re in trouble."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,You’re in trouble.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,I think I’ve made my point.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,"Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,What’s that?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,No.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Good. There there was really all I had.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Good night Leonard.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Hi Penny.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,I’m fine.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,It’s not your fault.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,So why was he at your party?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,There there.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Nothing, you’re perfect."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Yes you are.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Penny?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,How much have you had to drink tonight?
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here?"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive."
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,Probably.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Leonard,"That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)"
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Thank you for the clarification.
1,6,The Middle Earth Paradigm,Sheldon,Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,So? We’ll start now.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Sure. What’s going on.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,8:08.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Oh good grief.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and we’re still not playing Halo."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he gets back."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"One on one? We don’t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Great idea.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Mine.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,It’s the only way we can play teams.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Yes, but whoever’s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh…. (another explosion)"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, this isn’t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who’s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, she’s got me cornered, cover me."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Penny, you are on fire."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, that’s it, I don’t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,What?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,I guess for you that’s an option.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Good night.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"She’s an enigma, Raj."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"And another thing, there’s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab…"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"She’s gone, Sheldon."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"It’s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,What’s wrong?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Are you sure?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Where do I begin?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Well first, we don’t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I’d ask you to leave."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,So?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"He’s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It’s the logical fallacy of extending someone’s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, well since I’m obviously being ignored here, let’s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Here you go.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Hmmph, wrong."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"It’s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Hm!
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush I’ll jump out that window. Please don’t come to my funeral. Have a good night.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Sorry about that.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Well, sleep tight."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,What are you doing?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Penny’s still sleeping.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal…."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Almost 6:30.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Oh, no, it’s 6:30 in the morning."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Well there’s one beloved children’s book I’ll never read again.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Leonard.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Well then, it’s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I’ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it’s more like Doctor Why Bother."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"No more talking, everybody go."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,I imagine there aren’t many kosher corn-huskers.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So’s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,I see a problem.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"So, we’ll just order three entrees."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"He’s putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that’s punishable by death."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll each have four."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"No, if we fill up on dumplings we’ll need to eliminate another entree."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"And divide it how, I’m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,We don’t order egg rolls.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Exactly, but we’d have to if she was here."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for Indian food."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,No.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,I’ll know.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Yeah, we can always divide soup."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don’t think I need to tell you what an honour this is."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"You can’t go out, it’s Halo night."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Then it’s not dancing night.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Tonight is Halo night, it’s like talking to a wall."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Yes, but you didn’t portray her as completely irrational."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can’t, there are three of us and two of them."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,So?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"It’s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child’s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"Your anger’s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Who are you calling?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,My point.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,It’s Halo night.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,Shhh!
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"I can’t shoot now, I’m cloaking."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,"That’s why the call it cloaking, dead man."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,We said no tanks.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher."
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Sheldon,And now you’re out of life. Why did you hit pause?
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,I thought I heard something.
1,7,The Dumpling Paradox,Leonard,"No, never mind, alright, go."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Damn you, walletnook.com."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Problem?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don’t tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it’s a nightmare."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,It’s been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Why?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,It says keep this on your person at all times. (Knock on door) It’s right here under Batman’s signature.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Hi.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Hi!
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Hi.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"If I may, your parents probably don’t consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children’s lives."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,You seemed confused.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Actually, I read somewhere that it’s one of the most popular programmes in India."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one’s children enter the medical profession.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,I bet you’re right.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,What’s not to love?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,I suggest you go through with it.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"I’m not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Understandable, but there’s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,What?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"No need, we have the special edition."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Hey, I thought you were finding new friends."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,So don’t call her.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,So call her.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"I’m done, anybody else?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Okay, there’s a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Look, Penny, we’d love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn’t drink, so… (Raj whispers in his ear) Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he’d like to take up drinking."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Whatever you recommend.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,I’ll have a diet coke.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Fine. I’ll have a virgin cuba libre.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Yes,"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Yes. And would you make it diet?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,It’s amazing.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Um… Raj.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,And now we’ll never know.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Wait a minute, what’s the plan here? Let’s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Sorry I’m late.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,What happened?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Nothing, I just really didn’t want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"So, how’s Koothrappali d…. oh my Lord."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,What?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,That’s Princess Punchali.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,It’s a children’s story.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It’s about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,You Indian.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,What?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,I’m not hitting on her.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,I could eat.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Beats the hell out of me.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely Raj’s fault."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"No, I’m Leonard."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,What did I do?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to each other.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"Take it, Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,And may I point out she wouldn’t have asked me to go with her if you hadn’t been drunk and boring.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"And boring, her words."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"Okay, well, good night."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn’t already know, and I came home."
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,So you’re not going to see her again?
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Sheldon,Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. (Exits)
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not having grandchildren.
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,"I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him?"
1,8,The Grasshopper Experiment,Leonard,You didn’t?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, the X10s are online."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable public access."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes off and on again.) See!"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,They found the remote controlled cars.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Wireless webcams, wave hello."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,You may want to put on slacks.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Who’s running the red Corvette?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"You know, in the future, when we’re disembodied brains in jars, we’re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Not to mention you’d have to power down on Saturdays.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,I know. I read it before I threw it out.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn’t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Forget the parties.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"No we don’t. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,You can’t. I’m the lead author.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author is because we went alphabetically."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You’re welcome."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,It doesn’t need proving.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"They’re not supposed to, but they should."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to the conference and I’m presenting our findings."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,And I forbid it.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You forbid it?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,If I’m not taking credit for our work then nobody is.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, you admit that it’s our work."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"No, once again, I’m throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Ah!
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Not only is he still not talking to me, but there’s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put’s fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"They don’t, that’s why I saved this one."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Oh.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Great, be right back."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Here?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"No, I’m not shy."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s nothing to see, well, not nothing…."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Putting them on.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So it works as two."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,My last growth spurt.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Great.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I’m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Oh dear God!
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,A little misunder…. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Huh.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,I couldn’t poop this morning.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,It’s certainly preferable to my plan.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,A powerful laxative.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Excuse me, little idea?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Of course you didn’t, he said little idea?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"In what words then, exactly"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,What did he say?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Don’t you ever speak to me again.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,What… (Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door).
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving for the conference."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Then why did you say it.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Were you trying to impress Penny?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"No, no not at all. A little bit."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,How’d that work out for you?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Libido 1, truth zero."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"And I’m telling you for the last time it’s pandering, it’s undignified and bite me."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Let’s go.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard’s brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"You’re right, this side does look better."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You’re kidding.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. (Raj and Howard laugh.) Right?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"It’s a classic, right?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny is asleep on Howard’s shoulder. Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.) Are there any questions?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Any other questions?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not science."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton’s head, was that just an anecdote?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You are not Isaac Newton.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"No, no that’s true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"You continue to underestimate me, my good man."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don’t need validation from lesser minds. No offence."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Really, so why did you come?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Because I knew you’d screw this up.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,I didn’t screw it up.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,So you admit that you’re an egotist?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Yes. (To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Okay, that is it. (Tries to explode brain again.)"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Then I’ll settle for an aneurysm.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"You hit me. You saw him, he hit me."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You were trying to blow up my head.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,So it was working.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh we’ll see about that (tries again), heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start to fight.)"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,You could have offered me a ride home.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"I really don’t understand what you’re so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there’s just no pleasing you."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,"You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs help."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Well that’s not much of an apology, but I’ll take it."
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,Yes. I’m sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,What?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Now, who would do that?"
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Leonard,Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
1,9,The Cooper Hofstadter Polarization,Sheldon,"Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I’m like a flamingo on Ritalin."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in Terminator 2."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"(Buzzing noise), too late, I win."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,What the hell is that?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"I don’t know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. (The continue up the stairs and disappear from view)."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and (seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby) throw away some chicken. (Sheldon very reluctantly does.)
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, I give up."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I have a conclusion based on an observation.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,No you don’t. No he doesn’t.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I think I know.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,No you don’t. He doesn’t.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I think that’s a week from Tuesday at six.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"No, it’s this Friday, at eight."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,See you. (Penny exits singing)
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,You just lied to Penny.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Yes, I did."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,So?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,That’s very true.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard…"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,What?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I need to speak to you.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,It’s two o’clock in the morning
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,It’s important.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,I highly doubt that. Go away. (Long pause). Are you still out there?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Yes.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"You’re right, it can wait until morning."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you’re in no state to talk."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Sheldon, what is it?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,What was I supposed to say.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,You could have told her the truth.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,That would have hurt her feelings.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Is that a relevant factor?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Yes.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,And what would I have said afterwards?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I’d recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing again."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Why?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,I was not aware of that.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Well now you are.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Oh, alright. Leonard."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Yes.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can’t wait to play you again. Goodnight."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock)….."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. (Opening door) What?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"I was analysing our lie, and I believe we’re in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,How?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (door opens) Good morning."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Remember how Leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Yes, well, he lied."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"He lied, and I’m feeling very uncomfortable about it."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Hungry? Tired? I’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,To help you.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Hunger? Indigestion, I’m sorry I’m really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we’re going to participate in my cousin Leopold’s drug intervention."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Your cousin Leopold?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it’s important."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,What’s important?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Do you have a cousin Leopold.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No, I made him up. I think you’d call him Lee."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"I don’t get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Un-unravelable?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she’ll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Ah, because it’s in Long Beach, and I don’t drive."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,We’re going to Long Beach?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No, of course not, there’s no cousin Leo, there’s no intervention, focus Leonard."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, come on!"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,So he goes back into rehab?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,You still told her I lied.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I’m assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"That’s the best part, you don’t have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Un-unravelable.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, well, thankyou."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, okay, alright, good."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,I don’t know what to say.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Howard, listen…"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Okay, sure. I don’t see a problem with that."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Well… I don’t know what to say.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Good for you.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, another hug, thank you."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Thanks Penny.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Break a leg. (She leaves)
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"No, we’re not going to Long Beach."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"It’s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it’s iffy."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard…"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No, that’s the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it, it’s over."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Sadly, it’s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Why not?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Because Leo is a middle child.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"There is no Leo, how can you say that?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"You didn’t read the bio, did you? He’s not just a middle child, he’s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,I’ve got a solution.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Great, what is it?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Get out.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Fine. (He leaves. A moment later he comes back.) I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I’m just trying to clean up after your mess. (Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.) We’ll talk in the morning."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Who are you?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Sheldon?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Oh…!
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Subtextually, of course. (There is a knock on the door.) Just have fun with it. (Opening door.) Morning Penny."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me about your showcase last night?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,There were only two people there?
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Don’t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,There have been studies.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s give them some privacy."
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Sounds good.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,"Gee, why wouldn’t I?"
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,Yeah! Funny how things work out.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,Your parents made the right decision.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Leonard,How long is he going to stay here.
1,10,The Loobenfeld Decay,Sheldon,"He’s a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Checkmate.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,O-o-o-o-h! Again?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Just reset the board.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Hey!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,From the data at hand you really can’t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,How was your family?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Sick?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Here we go.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Friday, was that morning or afternoon?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Think woman, who blew their nose and when?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s not contagious."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a germophobe."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,What?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,With lime jello?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I don’t think so.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what’s growing in my throat.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I’m going back to bed.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the bathroom.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,What for?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I mix pancake batter in this!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"No, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,It’s right here on the bottom.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard, where are you?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,At six-thirty in the morning?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Yes.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,On Sunday?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Yes.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Why?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,They asked me to come in.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,They texted me.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,No kidding?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Drink whatever you want.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I want soup.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Then make soup.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,We don’t have soup.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"I’m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.)"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Is that a dog?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Yes,"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,In the lab?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Affirmative, with fever."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Howard, listen to me."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m sick."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I need soup.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I tried to stop you.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"I’m sick, thank you very much."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You’re doomed!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I want soup.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest green?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny!"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I’m… uh… at work.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny. (Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there’s a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Thanks for bringing me home.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Good. Good.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Wait, where are you going?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,You’re going to leave me?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, of course, but, not by myself."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Agreed.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Oh great.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, at home."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,You want me to get eye surgery?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I’m thinking!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"What do you see, what do you see."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Raj?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Fine.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Won’t my footsteps set it off?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,What?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Then just say go straight.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,It wasn’t on?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Then why did I have to crawl?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Okay, it’s on."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I know.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Hi!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Well, I had to, you see what he’s like."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,No!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,W-wait!
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m hungry!"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon appears in his comforter.)
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I want grilled cheese.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,I’m very congested.
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"Yeah, so?"
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Leonard,"If I stand, I’ll vomit."
1,11,The Pancake Batter Anomaly,Sheldon,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Here’s the problem with teleportation.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Lay it on me.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,How about that.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"No, he would be exactly the same."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,That is a problem.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"So, you see it too."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Graduate work, very impressive."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Advantage Kim.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Yes sir.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,I sense a disturbance in the force.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"So, Dennis, how long have you been in America."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"No kidding, you speak English really well."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,What are you talking about?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Nope. Goodbye.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Keen observation, goodbye."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Leonard.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Huh, yeah?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Get him out.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve got nautilus equipment."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Not heavy ones.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I haven’t considered it?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Get him out Leonard.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Fourteen and a half.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at anything."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Hey.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Hey.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Great.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Great.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Great.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don’t need any help."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Yes.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,It would blow up.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Are you sure?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Pretty sure.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Alright.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Go away.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me, you’re name can go first… I’m going."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Really, how does it work?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Yes.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I’m missing.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Curiouser and curiouser.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"If he were, I wouldn’t be."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Is that even possible?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m not saying no."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,What?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Howard, he’s fifteen."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams door.)"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll appreciate this, very exciting."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,The Jewish people.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"We’ll make it nice, put out a spread."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"I really don’t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Said Pharoah to Moses.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,It’s take your daughter to work day.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"No, we can’t."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Well, we’re not in India."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Okay, that was uncalled for."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,The kid got a girl.
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Yeah, mission accomplished."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”"
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Leonard,"Yeah, we really ruined his life."
1,12,The Jerusalem Duality,Sheldon,"Screw him, he was weak."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it’s an extremely private matter."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,What did you spill on it?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,I’ll take a look at it.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"You’re kidding, why not?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Well count me out.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four people."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words to you."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"No, don’t."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,The needs of the many.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Or the one. Dammit, I’ll do it."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,The ladies?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"I don’t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,I will yield.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,He does.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Yes.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Of course.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re one on one and smell nice."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just start."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,I knew that too.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"But I answered, it’s called teamwork."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I’m a mammal.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Just ask another one.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,And of course it’s Gravity Probe B.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Why?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn’t I give them?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh please, you don’t even have a PhD."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Howard, sit down."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Just look. I’ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Why do they say AA?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Army Ants.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh neat, what’s the occasion?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you’re off the team."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,What?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,No you didn’t.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Yes we did, I just came from it."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Okay, I don’t know where you just came from, but it couldn’t have been a team meeting because I’m on the team and I wasn’t there, ergo the team did not meet."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you’re off the team."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Why?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Thanks for the heads up.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,You’re welcome. One more thing.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Yes.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"It’s on, bitch."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"So nothing, let’s destroy him."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics bowl team."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Yes.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like to get on with my question now."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,She’s in.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for the whole thing."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Sheldon.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"So, is that your team."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Actually, I don’t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Leslie Winkle?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Yes, well, I’m polymerised tree sap and you’re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Here’s your tee-shirt. (Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.)
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,The Eta Meson.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Formal protest.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is Technetium."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Prevost’s theory of exchanges.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,A sigma particle.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,What the hell is that.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Come on, think, Leslie."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"You’re never going to let that go, are you?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Sorry, I panicked."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Um, eight. (Gablehouser stares at him.) Point four."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing?"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. (Makes fist in the air). Ow!"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Well it’s not what he said.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,I want a different question.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Formal protest.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Informal protest.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,No. I decline to provide one.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,That’s your opinion.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,I don’t understand the question.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Go ahead.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Sorry, somebody’s sitting there."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Who?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy!
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,I know someone who would disagree.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Who?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"My Physics Bowl Trophy! (In weird voice) “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Alright that is very immature.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"You’re right, I’m sorry. (In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon’s face) I’m not!"
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,What are you doing?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Absolutely.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,Bring it on.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,How do you know these things?
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,William Shatner.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Leonard,"Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner."
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Then it’s got to be Patrick Stewart.
1,13,The Bat Jar Conjecture,Sheldon,Formal protest.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,I don’t believe it.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"I know, it’s basic culinary science."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Uh-huh.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Yeah. And that’s my bid.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,You bid $800.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Come on, snipers."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Where are your snipers?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Snipe.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Snipe.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Snipe!
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,SNIPE!
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Aaaa-aw!
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one else bid.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,I understand why no-one else bid.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time machine” and “need $800”."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Come on, guys, push."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Yeah.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"It’s… you know, time machine."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Uh, just give us a few minutes."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Seconded.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,That sounds fair.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Then no.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,No.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an “oh”.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"So, when it’s your turn you can."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s up."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.) That was fun."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Are you okay?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,That doesn’t sound too bad.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Sorry.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Time machine.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Again, time machine."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Leonard, it’s two in the morning."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,So?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,It won’t change the past.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Are you upset about something?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,What was your first clue?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability…"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Yes I’m upset.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering you?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Wow, I’m on fire tonight."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Those are movies.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That’s absurd.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Come on, guys, push."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Some things are more important than toys. (She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,It’s still my turn.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,What are you doing?
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,It’s not about money.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Because I don’t want it any more.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Just… personal reasons.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I’m getting rid of all of it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Not for long.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"What’s the number, I’ll match it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,What’s the exchange rate.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Who cares, as long as you pick me."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Sheldon, get out of my way."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,You hypocrite!
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"No, I needed to hear it."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,Yeah.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.)"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,We have to get rid of the time machine.
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big."
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Leonard,"I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the door.)"
1,14,The Nerdvana Annihilation,Sheldon,"Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes up in his own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t have a bulletin board. (Sees crowds in the corridor) What’s going on?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Maybe she’s his lawyer.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Howard…
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh, hey buddy."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Buddy.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"How can you be late, I wasn’t expecting you at all."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you’ve already met Howard."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"You too, swell, also."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"So, how do you two know each other."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Excuse me?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"She’s my twin sister, she thinks she’s funny but frankly I’ve never been able to see it."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Rajesh.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn’t she."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"They call me a genius because I’m a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I’m having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay with us tonight?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,No we don’t.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,So what? I don’t issue invitations to your mother.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,And don’t ever call me Shelly.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,What just happened?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hee-hee, just classic."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Those are not mine.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,I wasn’t staring!
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I’m not ignoring my sister. I’m ignoring all of you.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,I brought snacks.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Onion dip, it’s onion dip."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,We don’t entertain much.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Bye Missy, see you."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s sister."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hell, no!"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Excuse me, can I interject something. I’m ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I guess. Don’t worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Thank you.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,That’s okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It’s noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"That’s fascinating, but I…"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I didn’t say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz… they’re hitting on your sister."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Oh. Okay. You know, I don’t want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we’d be a lot further along in this conversation if you’d begun with that thought."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"That’s great, but I…."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,What I’m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Why?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Because she’s your sister.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I don’t understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I hadn’t considered that. We do share DNA.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Uh-huh.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You’re right. If someone wants to get at Missy’s fallopian tubes, they’ll have to go through me."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Alright, that’s enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I’m going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"He’s the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You’re out too, by the way."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Say what?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"We all make mistakes, let’s move on."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,How so?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Oops.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Sit down.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,And he’s down!
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I weep for humanity.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny’s door.)
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,"Oh. You have other plans, or…?"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Leonard,Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory."
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)"
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,Really?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,I’m a theoretical physicist.
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,What’s the difference?
1,15,The Porkchop Indeterminacy,Sheldon,"My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it’s called trestling."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"He can’t eat cheesecake, he’s lactose intolerant."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,What about the cream cheese frosting.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t think so."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,I don’t celebrate my birthday.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"It’s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she’d also denied him Christmas he’d be a little better at it."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so…7"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I’m aware of, and you know I don’t care for chit-chat."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Well alright, but I don’t see this as a promising endeavour."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn’t want a party."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,In addition I really don’t think that Leonard wants a…
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"You can’t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it’s no longer mint."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Well of course I… oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let’s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"That’s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. (He knocks two, one, two.)"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one’s co-conspirators.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Possibly, but unverified."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,That’s because I didn’t bring one.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Let’s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it’s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Oh. Fair enough.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don’t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Hey.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Fine.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Seen it.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Oh. Pass.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Not if you believe his doctors.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,No.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"You mean, like a sweater?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Something he wouldn’t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like… oh, an 802.11n wireless router."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying “oh, that did not feel good.”) Come on, come on, oh you clever little…. Come on, come on, take that!"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,What’s the matter?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Oh my God, why did you eat it?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Now?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,What do you think.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"He doesn’t need them, he’s already got a 640 connect switch"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Why?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Penny! If I’m going to buy Leonard a gift, I’m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me… wow, this is hard. They got me… a motorised dirt bike."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Really?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Huh?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, I suppose."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,I know everything about this stuff.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, she doesn’t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,It depends on what Bus you have.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. (To woman approaching) You hold on, I’ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don’t say a white one?"
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Why not?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Alright, I’ll be right back."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Okay, we don’t have that in stock, but I can special order it for you."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,Why?
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Yes he is.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"There is a party, isn’t there."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Howard.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, it’s okay."
1,16,The Peanut Reaction,Leonard,"Hey Penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. (Copies hand movements.)
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,That’s what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it’s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Why?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Mai du lui tsa.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"My apologies Leonard, I’m only as good as my teacher."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Why are you learning Chinese?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what they’re passing off as chicken."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,What’s going on?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Okay, where were we?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Penny, are you okay?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful…."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Okay, feel better, bye. (Goes back to apartment) She doesn’t want to talk."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Not surprising. Penny’s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless. (Leonard stares at him.) Or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"It was Penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"You know what, I’m going to go back and try talking to her again."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Howard."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,I’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,What about “damsel in distress?”
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You’d also have to be knighted for that to apply."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"I don’t care. She’s upset, I’m going over there."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"I’m her friend, I’m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Wait, did you say wait?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,No. No.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Of course not.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"I’m sorry, what were the choices again?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Yeah, no, sure."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Actually it’s not all that easy to find.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought…. never mind."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Doesn’t that violate the health code?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Maybe a little.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Yes, you should, go ahead, say it."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s a betrayal."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I’m pretty sure I never said that.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Aw, good for me. Where are you going?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Howard, I’m going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn’t make my point with those people."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"I like tangerine chicken, I’m not getting tangerine chicken."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Just roll the dice.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"I’d love to, but I don’t have tangerine chicken."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,What happened?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I know that part."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Already, that was quick."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I am so sorry."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Yeah, that must get old quick."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,What about me?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guy…
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Yes what?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Really?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Yeah. That’s the spirit.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your…"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Yes, I suppose he is."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  (Time shift) And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. (Begins to unlock apartment door.)"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,We’re not done?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,It’s a common mistake.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Well of course you don’t get it, I haven’t made it yet. You’d have to be psychic to get it, and there’s no such thing as psychic."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Just like Schrodinger’s Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger…"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"I can see that. Unless you’re planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"No, it’s about Penny."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you’ll have to narrow it down."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Then don’t.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Other people would say “why not?”
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Other people might be interested.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I’m going to talk anyway.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,I assumed you would.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny, I’m not excited, I’m nauseous."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Right.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,You’re not helping.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,Schrodinger’s Cat.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Wow, that’s brilliant."
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Sheldon,"You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du. (Your monkey sleeps inside me.)"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Hi.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,I made an eight o’clock reservation.
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?"
1,17,The Tangerine Factor,Leonard,Good. (He grabs her and kisses her.)
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"So you see, what you’re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,It’s also not pink and has no berries.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What was your question again?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"So, gas."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,There was a draft.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Why don’t we just go into your….
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go fast."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,That might work too.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.)
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"What are you talking about, the date went fine."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,I’m not the fish.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, even I know that’s lame."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,I didn’t say anything like that.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,That’s not a bad sign.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,That depends.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you were neither."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,You’re asking me to keep a secret?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,You could be Batman?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I’m Batman. See.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Hey.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What about Saturday?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.)"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,No I didn’t.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What’s going on with you?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.)
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What’s wrong with your face?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I said Good Day! (He leaves)
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Good day?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Why don’t you take a minute to decide (leads her away) I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,There doesn’t have to be a reason.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, there kind of does."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving out."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,I’m still confused.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any simpler."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,No.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,No.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,No.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,That was fast.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Where are you gonna live?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,This could work.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,This is a very old building.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re not that familiar with Indian cinema."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Now, only if you want to."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether…"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel…."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"I’m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What’s with him?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I’m ba-ack!
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,I still don’t know why you left.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I can’t tell you.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,Why not.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I promised Penny.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,You promised Penny what?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,What secret. Tell me the secret.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can’t tell Dad."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Not that secret, the other secret."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I’m Batman. Shhhhh!
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,I promise.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,I drank milk that tasted funny.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Sheldon,"I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there’s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.)"
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a paralegal."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city college."
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,That doesn’t matter to me at all.
2,1,The Bad Fish Paradigm,Leonard,"Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me!"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Please let it go, Sheldon."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,You’re nitpicking.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Hi.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"So, yeah, good to see you."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You’re wearing modern underwear?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,You went out and bought linen?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Borrowed?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Of course. Out of respect.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Why not?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,What happened to you?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Oh no.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,How?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"If we were, the food would be better."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Uh, sure."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Where did you hear that?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Really, what changed?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Sounds fun.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very thoughtful."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Terrific.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,I kind of have other plans tonight.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Well, statistically speaking…"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You want me to leave the apartment?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Yes.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Yes.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Well alright then.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Alone?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,What do they have?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Pastries such as bearclaws?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I don’t like bearclaws.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s from Changs."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"No, Changs."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,It changed.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,A little.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,I sure hope so.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I have to make pee-pee.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Well, I think tonight was a very good start."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Sure.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Hello.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You mean like Spock?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Fascinating.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Don’t make this hard for me.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"You’re right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Penny.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,She called me dumbass.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"No, that response is unacceptable to me."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"If the word is pee-pee, just do it."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Thank you.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"I’m listening, amuse me."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"I hope so, it was a snort of derision."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Wait, where are you going?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Look on the bright side.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,What’s the bright side?
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,Only nine more months to comic-con.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,Oh yeah.
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,"Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading."
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?"
2,2,The Codpiece Topology,Sheldon,That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. (There is banging at the door.) Sheldor is AFK. (Goes out to find Penny having trouble getting into her apartment.) Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Alright then. (Turns to return inside. One of the grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries.)
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure…."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they’re almost pure protein."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,There there. (Reluctantly) Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Alright then. (Turns to go inside again.)
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Make yourself comfortable. (Sits in Sheldon’s place.) Not there. (Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table. Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon sits and replaces headset.) Sheldor is back online.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,The Conqueror.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Sheldor, back online."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,AFK. Away from keyboard.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,What does that stand for?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Yes, but what does it stand for?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,What’s going on?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it’s starting to attract wildlife.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for treasure."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Want to catch me up?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Do you have the enchanted sword?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme. (Takes laptop.)"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"There you go, one enchanted sword."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,That girl needs to get a life.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,You’re in my bedroom.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,People can’t be in my bedroom.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,I spilled grape juice.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,No she doesn’t.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. (His phone rings.) Oh, Penny!"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"God, no."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help you. We’ll talk when I get home. (Puts phone down) I’m not getting the computing time, am I?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d be interfering with that too."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Why should I do something, you’re the one who introduced her to online gaming."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what else to do."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Yes.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,I’ll go talk to her.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Wow.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Penny’s been keeping him up at night.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s playing non-stop."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Sheldon, wake up."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to do this."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my room.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Leslie, you are way off base here."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action. (Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.) Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Would you like to be?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Sheldon…
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"There, problem solved."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of 23?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Right. 22. (Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,What happened to the rest of your group?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Frenzy stance.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,These are market research questions. I’m filling out the online registration for your game.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Drink a healing potion.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh yes, it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Good to know. Big old five.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Hello.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Leonard, this is Tom."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,Chosen by science?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,This is bad.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,"Really, really bad."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she’s a big old five.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I’d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,Can we talk about this later.
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Sheldon,"But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
2,3,The Barbarian Sublimation,Leonard,They never do.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Let’s see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I’ll tell you why.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Penny, you don’t have to do that."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You’d do the dolphins.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I’m confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,What people?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Are you proud of yourself?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"In general, yes."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh, there’s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren’t you, you little subatomic Dickens?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Well, we’re going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Apologise, for what?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren’t very supportive."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I sense you’re trying to tell me something.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Really, do tell."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I had not considered that.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Come on.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I often forget other people have limitations. It’s so sad.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Not really, it’s what you and I would call condescension."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"And when we go in there, let’s show Raj that we’re happy for him."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,But I’m not.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want me to do?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Smile. (He does, exaggeratedly.)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"We’re here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Close enough, come on. (Knocking and entering.) Hi Raj."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? (He smiles.)
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Dr Gablehauser.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Dr Gablehauser.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Sheldon!
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Oh, sorry. (Smiles)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"He gets a new office, I can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Sheldon.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Damn, this is hard. (Smiles)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You can stop smiling now.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Aaaah!
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,No.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. (Leonard nudges him. He smiles. Phone rings.)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Not yet.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You just got him this afternoon.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,A lackey?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Now?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Almost.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"There’s a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Well, uh, no I… the… no."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"I can make it, but I won’t."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Now?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Now. (They all get up and leave. Raj looks around himself, then leans over to the next table.)"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Hey.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You look very nice.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Good night.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yeah.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Terrific.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Anythingforagreencard.com?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You’re joking.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Pass.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"It’s not a date, and that’s racist."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Let’s just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Yes.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Thank you.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You’re welcome.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,What took you so long?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Just sit down and eat.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Fine. (Opens carton. Shows it to Leonard in disgust.)
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Alright, it’s shredded, what do you want me to do?"
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,I want you to check before you accept the order.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Sorry.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,He’s not going to have intercourse with Penny.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Then there’s no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"That’s Northwest Texas, I’m from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Yes, Lucky."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"He’s irony impaired, just move on."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,A griffin?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Yes, half eagle, half lion."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,And mythological.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,You want to breed a new friend?
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"That’s one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we’re playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn’t kill us to meet some new people."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,"Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I’m not insane, my mother had me tested."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back."
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Sheldon,He should share our love of technology.
2,4,The Griffin Equivalency,Leonard,"Yeah, let’s see, money, women, technology, okay we’re agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Good morning, Leonard."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Uh-huh.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at me."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,I’m not going to work.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years, that’s no reason to give up."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,No.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Then you can drive. Let’s go.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that you’d have to make other arrangements."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,You did.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,And?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I didn’t. Let’s go.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Goodnight, Sheldon."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,But how am I going to get to work?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Take the bus.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny…"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Leonard’s asleep.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No, wait. You have to drive me to work."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are friends?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me to work.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check your engine."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not fine."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Is there a “check the check engine light light”? (Penny takes a drink of coffee) O-o-o-oh!
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Of course not.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,You’re going up Euclid Avenue?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see, you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing diagnostics."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Okay. I’ll give it a shot. (Gets out. Penny drives away.)
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,I just got here.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Good, perfect timing."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next few weeks."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is from work."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Howard, help me out here."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Now, how do you propose I get home?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,How did you get here in the first place?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,We had a difference of opinion.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,You want to go to pottery barn first?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the door) Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Good morning.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, sit down."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don’t have a problem.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Why Penny?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Hold on, I have one condition."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,And Radio Shack.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,And the comic book store.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert Einstein never had a driver’s license."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I was otherwise engaged.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I’m actually more of a theorist.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Oh.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Yes?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,No.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t need your help, Penny."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Aced it.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Booting.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Ooh!
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,No.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the fuzz."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Okay, fasten your seat belt."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Click. Now, are there air bags?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,You don’t need air bags.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Oh.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Watch out.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Thank you.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No. I quit. (Stands up. There is more sound of crashing and panic, then animal noises.)"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Aw, the pet store?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s amazingly detailed."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"So wait,you’re just gonna give up?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No, I’m not giving up, I never give up."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,So what is it you’re doing?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too evolved for driving.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,What does that mean?
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,No kidding.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,It’s never safe.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I know that now."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,Homo Novus doesn’t know.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into something with wings."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,"Good morning, gentlemen."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Hey.
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"No, he lives here now."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,"Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with my experiment."
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Leonard,Yep
2,5,The Euclid Alternative,Sheldon,You saw nothing! (Sweeps hood around himself and vanishes through cafeteria door.)
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I’m sorry that the demonstration didn’t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don’t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"If you don’t do this, I won’t take you to the comic book store."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Oh, good God."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you’ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Laser demonstration’s looking pretty good now, huh?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, yeah? Well… you’re a mean person."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,That is the prevailing opinion.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,The fact is I’m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,It’s what I do.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I do eat dinner.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Yes. Apparently I’m getting a free dinner.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Hey, Ramona. Come on in."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Uh, the kitchen’s fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Uh-huh. The viewing area’s right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona’s here."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. No, we were just going."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"No, come on, now, we’re going out."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Let’s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,What do you mean “deal”?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Honestly, we’ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he’ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Uh…
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,The one with the little onions? Mmm.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Don’t.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Hey, aren’t you having breakfast?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Yes.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Not in these pants.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"So, how’d it go with Ramona last night?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, great. She’s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Ramona pointed out that I’ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"You don’t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Touche.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Ah, hey Leslie."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, good one."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Wait for me.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Aren’t I?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Hey, Penny."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Why? What are they doing?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali’s. You coming?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Yes, I am. It’s Wednesday. Wednesday’s Halo night.</i>"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,He did.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Me. Sorry, Leonard."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Seriously? You’re not coming?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,You heard her. How can I argue with me?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I prefer to think of it as I’m pulling them forward.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,He does on Wednesdays.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Drat.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD. (Pause) And then never ever watch it.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Please, please, I don’t have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"I don’t know, but apparently I’m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Hide me.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I formally request sanctuary.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Um… she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don’t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Sheldon? (Pause, then more tapping) What are you doing?!"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,It’s Morse code.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Why?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,So we can communicate through the wall.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,We are communicating through the wall.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,I don’t know Morse code.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,It’s very simple. This is A (knock knock) this is B (knock knock-knock-knock) this is C…
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to learn Morse code at three o’clock in the morning!"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,All right.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t come in here, don’t (Sheldon enters) Aw! What’s going on?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Shh! Ramona’s sleeping on the couch.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,I know. When is she going home?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Never, that’s the problem. I need your help."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,What are you talking about?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I’m invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that’s taking over the Earth.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Come on! Don’t nitpick!
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Good night.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Shh. All right, I’m invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who’s been replaced with an alien pod.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Yes. She’s in the living room. Go, I’ll wait here."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Now! Do it!
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Godzilla clause?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Rats.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,And I could not have done it without you.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Who’s Nowitzki?
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Oh, you want me to share credit?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Get out!
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Maybe when I publish it, I’ll include an inhaler."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Let’s see, today’s Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomo’s. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,What a nice girl.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m getting a free pizza. I’m on a roll."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,"More Pad Thai, please."
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,Just one more bite.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Sheldon,I’m just so… full.
2,6,The Cooper Nowitzki Theorem 2,Leonard,That’s it. No more Thai food.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, I have pokh."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Potl.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Pukhpa.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Really? Define it.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Bilurrrbe.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,What’s wrong with your TV?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Penny, but we’re…"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"No, no, don’t tell her."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,…playing Klingon Boggle.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Aw!
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"All right, Boggle warriors, kapla’!"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,They’re gorgeous.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad that’s a proper noun."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Is qochbe’ spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Sheldon, the food’s here."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,What are you doing?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Why?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Is my hamburger medium well?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Dill slices, not sweet?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Individual relish packets?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Onion rings?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Extra breading?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,I asked.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,What did they say?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,No.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Did you protest?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Yes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Vociferously?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,No.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Well, then what took you so long?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Just eat.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Here you go.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Put it on the agenda.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, I’ll make a motion, but you’re not going to like it."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Sheldon’s onion ring. Just put it back!
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"No, no, no,  no, I don’t think that’s where it was."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Who touched my…
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Why would you do that?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Well, I’m sorry, but that is your second strike."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,You have two strikes. Three strikes and you’re out. It’s a sports metaphor.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Yes, baseball."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,The photo of the cat who wants to “has cheezburger”?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Don’t worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you’ve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Congratulations. You’re officially one of us.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,You’re sitting in my spot.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Leonard, she’s in my spot."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here’s the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"All right, that’s it. Strike three."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Listen, don’t worry. I’ll talk to him."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,To do what?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Are you insane? You’re not going to party with them, you’re not even going to get anywhere near that place."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Thank you.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Why?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"You can’t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Look, here’s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, come on, it’s easy, he’ll even tell you what to say."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,We’re not encouraging. It’s more like knuckling under.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Well, actually, technically, you did do it."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Thank you.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,You can recognize people on Google Earth?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,NORAD? You’re using military aircraft?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Problem with the WiFi?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"I reiterate, knuckle under."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, Penny, you don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"There, see? Problem solved."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Thanks a lot, Howard."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Oh! Hello.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,It’s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,What are you implying?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"No problem, I’ll just do my laundry another night."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Yes?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Your clothes?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Really? Despite the sign that says “Do not leave laundry unattended”?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Apologize.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,I’ve done no stupid things.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"I am meeting you halfway, I’m willing to concede that you’ve done some stupid things."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Mwah-ha-ha.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"No. Look, this has to stop."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"All right, I really didn’t want to do this, but… here."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Sheldon’s Kryptonite.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,He can never know that I gave that to you.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,It’ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,"Okay, for the record what you’re doing is really creepy."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Who is it?
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Your mother.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that’s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don’t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you’re right, I don’t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?"
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Leonard,Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny… (door opens) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here’s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished."
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Thank you.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Penny.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Well played.
2,7,The Panty Pinata Polarization,Sheldon,Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Oh look, Saturn 3 is on."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,In what sense is that a compromise?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Well, five is partway between three… Never mind."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Ooh, I don’t think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"It’s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Ahoy, matey."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"You’re not gonna need wingman, you’re gonna need a paramedic."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but I’m not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Well, I want to watch it now."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Then I believe we’ve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Watch whatever you want.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,What did I do?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,What happened?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Howard’s at the Mars Rover lab. He says he’s in trouble. Defcon 5.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Defcon 5? Well, there’s no need to rush."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,What?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,How can 5 not be worse than 1?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Okay, first of all, that’s a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,What’s the emergency?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Where?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,So what exactly do you want us to do?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Okay.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,No one’s a scientist like Howard.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Then why did you?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Got it. So, can I see you again?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Ooh. Cool.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Snap what?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Why wasn’t that Plan A?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Psst! Psst!
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Is there some problem?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"All right, goodbye."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Where are you going?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I can’t tell you that.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Who would ask me?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"I can’t tell you that, either."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, I really didn’t think this through."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Leonard, a moment."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,What?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Are you going to the office?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,No.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Then how can I say it convincingly?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Just say, Leonard went to the office."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I’m going to the office.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,See? Why don’t I believe you?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I’m going out for a while.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,So how was work today?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I’m hoping that’s three different guys.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Well, I wrote some of it down."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Dear God, no!"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Hey.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, a couple."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Thank you.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,I’m sorry?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Oh, she’s a doctor."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he’s dating someone, but he’s not because, in fact, you’re dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,On what?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Yeah.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Are you sure?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Does that change things?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,So why’d you ask?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Listen, I need to talk to you about something."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Oh, hey, guys."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,Hello.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Hi, Howard. Howard?"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"I don’t make the rules, Leonard."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Yeah, but I don’t see a better one on the horizon, so…"
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Sheldon,"Look I’m sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I’m out."
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,He just won’t listen to me.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,Hmm. Lisa’s gonna be disappointed.
1,8,The Lizard Spock Expansion,Leonard,"Howard, Howard, look at this."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Penny, hello."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,What is shaking?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,I’m striking up a casual conversation with you. S’u’up?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,No.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,The statement stands for itself.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Fine, whatever works."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Uh, peace out!"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, this is very pleasant."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,I stand corrected.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Thank you.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Good. What’s your favourite fruit?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Really? That’s where I was born!
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there’s even pasta left over."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,What landing party?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, my god, what did you do?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Oo-oo-oh!
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,What invitation?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, clearly I could have."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting “Ha!”)
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"No, just sit here."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, this is it."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Stephanie Barnett is single.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Give me one good reason why not.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Because this is not Star Trek
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,This is banana bread.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,How can you be sure?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Because?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, why not?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,May I come in?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny slams door). Clearly, I’m 14 days too early."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, hi Stephanie."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Want some more wine?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,What are you doing?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,I’m helping you with Stephanie.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,By making constipated moose sounds?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, for god’s sakes."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, I got it."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. (Leonard tries again. Then taps jar on counter. Jar breaks.)"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"No, I’m not. I’m bleeding."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Like a gladiator!
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Stitches? With a needle?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. (Throws up in sink)"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,Watery?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,She stuck a needle into my hand!
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,I didn’t cry.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Hey, can you open this for me?"
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Sure. (Holds out hand. Howard starts to retch).
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,What for?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"What? no. no, that’s not right."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my status."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"I had no choice, he cried in front of her."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,You hacked my facebook account?
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,In which I am not an expert.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of you.
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Leonard,"Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend."
2,9,The White Asparagus Triangulation,Sheldon,"If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Well, you’re the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Me, too."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Is it a high-frequency whistle?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, it’s more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Then it must be a tumour.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Maybe it’s a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll be right in."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"It’s not enough that she mocks me, but that isn’t even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Do you understand that Stephanie’s not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don’t think so.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Good night.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Leonard, there’s one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I’m calling an emergency meeting."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, you’re not."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I’d like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Thank you.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon “cohabitation” rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"I beg to disagree. “A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,That’s absurd.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I’m given to understand women have different needs, so, we’ll have to discuss that."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,I’m going to bed.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, absolutely not."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,It’s not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"I don’t care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Oh come on! Sheldon, we don’t ask questions like that."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,See? She’s not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"She’s heard about you because we’re, you know, involved and you haven’t heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"In Leonard’s defence, it wasn’t for lack of trying."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Leonard."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Look, I’m just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it’s very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I’ll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"She doesn’t like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, bye-bye."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Why do I feel like I’m the one that just got the prostate exam?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Oh, she is. She’s terrific, and she’s proving to be a valuable roommate."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Like hippies.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,How could I not be sure?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Don’t you think if a woman was living with me I’d be the first one to know about it?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not living together.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We’re not living together!"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,We’re not… Where’s my Bat Signal?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"I did. It was right here. She must’ve… Oh, my God, we’re living together."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got them for me."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Actually, I think it’s more of wool, fire ant blend."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,At least I have an egg. What do you have?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"So, go hit on her."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"I don’t care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Didn’t they teach you that in medical school?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,"Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, the pants that Stephanie got me."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Are you sure?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, no. I wish you’d told me that sooner."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, everything’s fine."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah. It’s wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it’s fine, it’s great."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Are you sure? That doesn’t sound right.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,No that doesn’t sound right either.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I’ll go do that. Thank you."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No, but that’s okay. I’ll go talk to her. Want to come with?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,Wha??
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,I knew it! What do I do?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Sheldon,For how…
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Sheldon. (He waves) What’s going on?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Careful, if you don’t get it all, it’ll only come back worse."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Listen, we need to talk."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,I don’t know what that means.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, um, well, look, it’s just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,It’s just a little scary.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, and it’s perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Okay, well, I ju… I think it’s important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,What’s that? Really? Right now?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"I just ate, aren’t you supposed to wait an hour?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, okay. I just hope I don’t get cramps."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Thank you.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Good.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Well, um, on one level, really, really well."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"And then the, the subject got changed somehow."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it’s all good. Everything’s going to work out. One way or another."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Really?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Huh.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here’s the thing, I’m afraid that if I ask her to move out, she’ll just dump me."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?"
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,What speech?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Terrific.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Hey.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It’s kind of fun."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that’s the fun part. We’re also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don’t even know what a duvet is but I’m pretty sure if I did I wouldn’t want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Isn’t that kind of cowardly?
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It’s done.
2,11,The Vartabedian Conundrum,Leonard,"Yeah, good for me. I’ll never have sex again. (Phone buzzes) I was wrong. See ya."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth’s yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Like what?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Raj, please, let’s stay serious here. Superman’s body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Superman doesn’t sweat on Earth.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,It’s David Underhill. So what?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"I have two words for you. The first is big, the other’s whoop."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you’ve done since you’ve been here completely useless.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Did not.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, y-yeah."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,You want to work with me?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here’s my home number, here’s my cell, here’s my office, here’s my parents’ number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You’ve never seen a hypocrite before?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Where were you that’s more important than Wii bowling night?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, I was…"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,I was working with Dave Underhill.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, he’s pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he’s a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"He’s funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That’s not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I’m gonna go practice my situps."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, because we don’t celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Wait! You bought me a present?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Why would you do such a thing?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny. I know you think you’re being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven’t given me a gift, you’ve given me an obligation."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you’ve given me. It’s no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, it’s too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I’m going to need a ride to the mall."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Ow! Ow!
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn’t it?"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s just a little motorcycle accident."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t know. It’s all such a blur.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,I’m not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don’t take melanoma lightly.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Since when?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Since when?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. I guess."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, if you like that type."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, just neighbours."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Actually, science is my lady."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun. (Bangs head on door. Sheldon opens it.)"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Yes? (Leonard falls through) Did you forget your key?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,I don’t see anything in here a woman would want.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It’s as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I told you before, bears are terrifying."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,That presupposes Penny is tense.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, we’re not. Let’s say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,You put no thought into that.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, I know. I’ve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don’t you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn’t going to detect itself."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"That’s funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Mmm, great news, Leonard, I’ve solved my Penny gift dilemma."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Yippee.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Brilliant.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Do whatever you want.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very gracious.     Gentlemen."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn’t want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You’d have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I’m like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what’s up with that?"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Never mind, we’re cool."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Really? Why would you say that?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,He tried to take nude photos of you?
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. I’m so… oh, that’s terrible."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Well, uh, the important thing is he’s married and that’s terrible!"
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Lactose.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Smooth.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Come on, it’s Christmas, just give me this one."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,Merry Christmas.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Ah, good, Penny, you’re here to exchange gifts. You’ll be pleased to know I’m prepared for whatever you have to offer."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I should note I’m having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don’t be alarmed. Oh, a napkin."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,Be right back.
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, then, I think you’ll appreciate what I got you."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,"You know, ’cause you’re so into science."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I know! It’s not enough, is it? Here."
2,11,The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,Leonard,It’s a Saturnalia miracle.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Maybe we should start small.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Did it when I was four. It’s an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,How about the toaster oven?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys’ room at the wrong time."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,That’ll do it.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Uh-huh?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Killer robot. We built it.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"If it wanted to kill you, you’d be dead."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Howard, why don’t we just work on the robot?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"I’m begging you, stop talking."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you’re the one who’s peculiar."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Howard, where you going?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Wow.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"I don’t know, now they’re just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Yes, we did, Kripke."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,His name is Monte.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Come on, is that really necessary?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I’m given to understand that your mother is overweight."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,There are boundaries.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,What do you mean?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Make it so.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"No, don’t make it so. Barry, we can’t fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,I need you to apologize to How…
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Come on. Wolowitz won’t come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,The robot didn’t hurt his feelings.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,He’s been in bed for two days.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,He’s not with a… does it really matter who or what he’s with? The guy is devastated.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Okay, don’t take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"You know, like, most of the time, you’re the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn’t get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Okay, let’s try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend’s apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,I came home with no pants.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,She’s a delightful woman. You’ll love her.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Oh, my God. That’s Kripke’s robot?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to call it off."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"We don’t have that option, we’ve accepted the challenge. We can’t run away from a fight."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Oh, please, we’ve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we’re up against and we can modify Monte so that he’s prepared.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Not yet.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Have faith, gentlemen. We don’t need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Nice little bot you’ve got here.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"What’s this do, spin?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we’ve got to call this off."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot’s massive size and its overwhelming power."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"I just want to make sure that we’re all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"He’s right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Never. I’d rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Do it.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (A flame begins to jet out of Kripke’s robot.) That’s new.
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Run, Monte, run!"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Go, go, go, go!"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"Don’t hurt us, don’t hurt us,"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,"Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Forget the robot. What happened to you?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"So what do you think, Howard? It’s not that bad, right?"
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,"You’re right. Monte’s gone. We’ll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I’ll speak. Leonard, you’ll play your cello."
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Sheldon,Just a toy robot?
2,12,The Killer Robot Instability,Leonard,Penny.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant…"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,It is extracted from the plant…
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore!"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Hey Kripke.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don’t you take some time to reconsider?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing suit, it’s a tan line."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don’t think it’s gonna happen."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,First warning.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Hi.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"You got it, buddy."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,I answered every question Sheldon.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,How could I not?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that I’d have better luck making friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Hold on. I put some real work into that!
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I don’t see how you could.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,What do you mean!?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I did learn how to swim.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,On the floor.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Then why learn how to swim?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m sure much of the research already exists."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Where are we going?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Family or friend?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill the void. (Woman moves away) It’s just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna go get a hot pretzel."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Oh! I love trains!
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you reading?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Oh I do like monkeys!
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, what are you doing?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your name?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"No you’re not, let’s go."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,We were really hitting it off.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Don’t look up, there’s cameras."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Yes, he’s new at the zoo."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,"Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. (Checking changes Howard has made to his flowchart) A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Little kid Hominids, perhaps. (To man who attaches him to ropes) Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like vertical swimming."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah, I don’t think I can."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"No, that doesn’t seem any more likely."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to pass out."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,How was rock climbing?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,D-d-d! That’s where I sit.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Want some Chinese food?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,In the bathroom.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,What’s that?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,Can I whistle?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"No. You, too, are safe."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?"
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,He had Lysine but changed it.
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,No? But we’re friends!
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Sheldon,"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys."
2,13,The Friendship Algorithm,Leonard,I didn’t think he had it in him.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Hmmm.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"We’ve got to be missing something. Let’s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Why? They’re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Well, it’s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don’t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning’s bowel movement occurring at work."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, you know I can’t do that."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Bye, Sheldon."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"They’re right, it was the only option."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Why?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Well, you didn’t specify."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I’m sorry, I don’t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Oh, I see. Penny, I’m not sure I’m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"If you recall, I pointed out the “check engine” light to you several months ago."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Hang on a moment. (He opens a jar. Snakes jump out. He then pulls out a large wedge of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,That’s why it’s guarded by snakes. Take some.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,I’m never silly. Here.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Don’t you need money?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,This is money I’m not using.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,I sincerely hope so.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Won’t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you’re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Of course you will. It’s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Interesting.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Ask me why.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Do I have to?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Of course. That’s how you move a conversation forward.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Why?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. How was work?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Was that sarca..
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Stop it!
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Penny, you appear to have a package here."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women’s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"He’s not lying, he does find that fascinating."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,All right.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Weird.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn’t sure."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Did you guys have an argument?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,No.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"I’m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there’s a blunder I overlooked."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Don’t worry about it. It’s my treat.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"It’s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Fourteen fifty, but it’s no biggie, you’ll get the next one. (Raj whispers something to Howard)"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"It was fourteen fifty, but it’s okay."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Dinner’s here."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Okay.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Oh, wait, you lent her money?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Where are you going?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I’ve moved my money out of the snake can."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"But if you’re ever short, there’s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern’s ass."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Hey.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"A little mood lighting, huh?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Yeah, they’re very considerate that way."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Fourteen dollars, huh?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn’t care when he gets the money back. It’s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn’t make you want to, you know, kill him."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,So you’re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Well, what was the plan?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Was there a plan B?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"It’s probably not as bad as you think. Let’s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here’s something, if you don’t have electricity, then you probably don’t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,You’ve had an acting job where you got paid?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Actually, it kind of… let’s keep looking. Whoa, what’s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Your ex-boyfriend?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,What?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,I would hope so.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Did he pay you back?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,And that’s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Oh, no. Oh, you don’t want to do that."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they’re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it’s just, like… Why don’t you just get a roommate and stay here?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Well, I’m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn’t mind moving in with you."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Really?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Hey, what’s going on?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Outside? I just made cocoa.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,– Come on. It’ll be fun.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Do you guys remember Penny’s ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all hold their hands above their heads) Yeah, that’s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I’m gonna go get it from him."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Really? You’re just gonna let me go by myself?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,I could use some help.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there’s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,I do.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don’t.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,I’m not afraid of him.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny’s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn’t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,They did.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Well?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"They had a terrible time of it, Leonard."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I’ll make this quest on my own.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"You guys suck. (Leaves. Comes back) Come on, please? He’s so big."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Okay, how about this? I’ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Hi, Kurt."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"I don’t really go by Lenny, but that’s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,You don’t remember me? How could he not remember me?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Sheldon, not now."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,I remember him.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Okay, here it is. Penny’s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"No, no, she’s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Feel is a kind of a… it’s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"No, the problem isn’t solved. He just blew us off."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,I’ve got it. He didn’t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,No. You can leave if you want to. I’m gonna see this through.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"I guess, technically, that was my fault. (Knocks) I’m not leaving here without Penny’s money."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,I don’t need backup. I have right on my side. And I’m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard has “I owe Penny $1800, Kurt” written on his forehead.)"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Hey.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,It’s kind of a fashionable look these days.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,Darn. I can’t seem to get the hang of that.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,"Hey, I know it’s none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Really? Did he say why?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,That’s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Bye.
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn’t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it’s his nature."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Penny’s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Sheldon,"That’s your badge of honour, your warrior’s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
2,14,The Financial Permeability 2,Leonard,Great.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Good to see you, Mother."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yes.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,I’ll start again.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the PowerPoint presentation."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,Aw…
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"So, Mother, what’s new?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"All right. Uh, what’s new with you?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Maybe something less personal.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,What a remarkable woman.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I envy you your childhood.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Please, don’t go there, Howard."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Boy, you suck."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,That was fast.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it’s location, location, location."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to women unless he’s drunk. Go.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,No.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,You went to the comic book store without me.7
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,You got alcohol?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Yep.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,You can’t let her get into your head.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Did you get the part?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,You know what the saddest part was?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,My father used to borrow it.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"Oh, I can’t believe that."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,Can I make you a cup of tea?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I feel very comfortable around you.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,I’d like to do the math.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Uh-huh.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we’re sharing."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"So, what do you think?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate we’d be very good together."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Sheldon,"You see right through me, don’t you?"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,This is actually gonna happen.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn’t get as children."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,I don’t know. Foreplay?
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”"
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father, and I’m okay with that."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey’s “Any Way You Want It” on Rock Star.)
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight."
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,Morning.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,You don’t have to. Ever.
2,15,The Maternal Capacitance,Leonard,"Good-bye, Mother."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,And I told you I wanted to see a doctor’s note.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Because you chose your mother’s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Yeah, more cutbacks."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don’t simply let some of you go so that there’s money available for my research.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"You know what baffles me, Sheldon?"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, but what’s with the back-scratching and the meow!"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Thank you.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Are you done?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I’m done."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"What about it, Howard?"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I don’t care about that.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,You and Leslie?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Is that why you didn’t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Calm down. We’ll figure it out.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,You’re in my spot.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"No, I’m going to the comic book store."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,What difference does it make?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Here we go.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Don’t sit in his spot.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,I’m not unhappy.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Okay, that should do it."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,That’s a lot of shoes you ordered.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,There’s a chance.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Well, we’re not gonna tell him I did it."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Mm, butt print. There’s no discernible butt print."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,It’s too small and too perfect.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,You’re welcome.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It’s a little chilly."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Koothrappali picked me up.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Isn’t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,They don’t talk incessantly for no particular reason.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"No, no, friends forgive the little things."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Don’t you dare, missy."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something’s wrong."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,What do you mean?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"I don’t know what you’re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Why don’t you just eat in your desk chair?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Why don’t I just eat in my desk chair?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don’t eat in my desk chair and I don’t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Wackadoodle.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog’s head in its place, would that be “problem solved”?"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"If it were your head, it would be."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"You claim it’s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Did you notice the sign on his counter? He’s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sake, Sheldon."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? “Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?”"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"No, it’s Leslie Winkle. It’s a long story."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,That’s not fair. You’re not even a physicist.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Get out.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Why are you crouching there?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I don’t know. Texas?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"From that key maker, I highly doubt it."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,All right.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,There’s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Nope.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Nothing, it’s what’s wrong with him."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,More?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I’m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Golden Dragon.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"No. No, this isn’t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"But. Oh, this changes everything."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,What’s real? What isn’t? How can I know?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Oh, God, I wish I had."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,Leonard?
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Yeah, buddy?"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,I still don’t like this cushion.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we’ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Right, just one thing before we start."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"What is it, Sheldon? (Sheldon shoots Penny)"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,That was for my cushion.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,"Sheldon, Penny was our only hope."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,She can’t shoot me. She’s dead.
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,He’s right. You can’t. (Shoots Sheldon)
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Sheldon,"Well, if we’re going to descend into anarchy (Shoots Leonard)"
2,16,The Cushion Saturation 3,Leonard,Where are you going?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Stop. We can’t do this, it’s not right."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"But once you open the box, you’ve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we’ve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Okay, then we won’t touch the hard drive. We’ll just erase the first season of Battlestar."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,It’s perfect.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"It’s just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"I understand your envy. This is a can’t-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green’s function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,You’ve heard of him?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,It’s like talking to a chimp.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Yeah, I wish."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"We’re not flying, we’re taking the train."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we’re taking the train."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Don’t say it like that, Leonard, say it like: we’re taking the train!"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, we’re all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, I always enjoy that, but I’m a little busy."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,What are you doing?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"I’m simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,I wouldn’t expect you to. I’ll see you later.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,What on earth are you doing?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you’ll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you’ll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,No.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Why not?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,That’s over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been on this train 90 seconds, and you’ve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Here. I’m hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ’cause it’s time to land in San Francisco."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways’ magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Oh, look, now he’s boring on an international scale."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Is that who I think it is?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Maybe John Connor’s aboard and she’s protecting him from an evil Terminator.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Unlikely. That’s a television show, Leonard."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Thank you.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that’s Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don’t kill me! I’m pro-robot! Ahh!"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,At least he’s off the train crap.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Whee!
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,My money’s on tuck and roll.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,I’m confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,All right.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Yes.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Excuse me, but what about me? Why don’t I get a shot?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"You know, I’ve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can’t score with. I think I’ll let you two take this one."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre…"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you’re going as far as Portland.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So aren’t you going to go talk to her?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"She’s probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don’t you just try hello?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,You’re going to need more than 11 hours.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, no."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,What’s the matter?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,I forgot my flash drive.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,So we have to go back.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I’m going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,You don’t understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,It’s brilliant. He needs to read it.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So you’ll send him an e-mail when we get back.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Then I won’t get to see his face light up as he reads it.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Right. Of course.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Well, there’s nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive (repeated over and over in time to the sound of the train)"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, I’ve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we’ll meet the train."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,I’ve got a better idea.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Are you going to be sarcastic?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny’s home. Why don’t we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,The key is hidden in my room.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Penny would have to go into my room.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,So?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,People don’t go in my room!
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"I see. Well, it seems once again, you’re caught between a rock and a crazy place."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Oh, I hate when that happens."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,It’s Sheldon.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,I’m not in San Francisco. I’m on a train. Were you even listening to me?
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"What’s up? I’ll tell you what’s up. I’m in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be…"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It’s Leonard."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"He’s calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn’t use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It’s a legal right"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Is that what he’s drinking? It’s not even real beer.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"I don’t know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Yes, I’m still here. Where am I going? I’m on a train. Now, what you’ll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman’s sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman’s Sphere. It’s a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,That’s the wrong box. Put it back.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Don’t read those letters!
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Put down the letters!
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. It’s Leonard."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Delightful. Listen, I don’t know what you’re doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon’s mouth."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,Thank you.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,I’m back.
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Leonard again."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"You’re holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You’ll hear a slight click."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"No, it’s a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Okay, now you’re going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I’m nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck’s mouth."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Hey, how’d it go?"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Excuse me. (Goes down to Summer) Okay, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you’re a human being; I’m a human being. I could just say to you…"
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Leonard,"Hi, my name’s Leonard."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"So, I’m thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you’ll be back on top."
2,17,The Terminator Decoupling,Sheldon,"Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Ready.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Damn it. I slipped.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Why?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,– Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,So?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don’t want to see naked."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,It’s eleven am.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,This package came while you were at work.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Excuse me.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,You have to sign this.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m fully indemnified and no longer liable."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Obviously, not a cleaning business."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Good for you. Sign here.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,What’s her name?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,And you’re going to let her handle my food?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,I think you’re just making that up.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,How many of these can you make a day?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Before taxes.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Of course I could.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my assistance."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I’m doing so.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything you’ve done up to this point is wrong.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Sarcasm. Good-bye.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,You’re questioning my math?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Want me to show my work?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Hello?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"W-W-Wait, what’s going on?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over. (They start singing again.)"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Hot glue.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"It won’t work, the flower’s too porous."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Intriguing.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Where?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Wow.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,It’s not my apartment.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Okay, what’s wrong with it?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,– What’s wrong with it?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"No, it doesn’t."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d strongly recommend that we let Leonard go."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,You want to fire me?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision. Penny?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,We should get to work.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Amazon offers one-day rush.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web design.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,What are you doing?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,How are we doing?
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"No, I don’t drink coffee."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing drugs."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"You’re right, of course."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him Sheldon prime…"
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Bam.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,I can’t believe we actually did it.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Leonard,"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey."
2,18,The Work Song Nanocluster,Sheldon,"No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s not that bad."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh!
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,What?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,No!
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,The horror!
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Why would you just say something like that?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,The horror!
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Why are you making it worse?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,What?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"I’m sorry, that really is how it works."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Raj, help me out here."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,The box says kitchen.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Hello.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Hello.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Yeah, it is."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Sheldon…
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,You’re making her uncomfortable.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Alicia?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Welcome to the building.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,I’m helping.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,You don’t jog.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You’re welcome, Penny."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,I think you look fantastic.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Come.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Congratulations, I see you did your laundry."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,How does one sort of…
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Alicia is an actress, just like you."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, I’d love to."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?"
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,You want to watch Battlestar?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,What’s wrong?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Oh, I’d watch that."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"Okay, well, I’ll take you."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,May I interject something here?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,You got the wrong mustard.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,What are you doing?
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Leonard,"I had to, she called me cutie."
2,19,The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition,Sheldon,"Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Problem?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,This is Thai food.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,You’re joking.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Oh, absolutely."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Fascinating.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,A superb choice.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Get her out of here.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Come on, I’ll help you pick something."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"I think we’re fine, Stuart."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"No, you!"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Problem?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Leonard, we need a ruling."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Uh, cut it in half?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Apparently so.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Are you ill?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,No.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Sure, why not?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Gee, thanks a lot."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,My original point.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"And you guys are going together, great…"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Hey, Howard?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Yeah.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Why?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,That’s your system?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,What are you doing?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,How about those two?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,I think Blinky’s cute.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Wait, so we just go over there?"
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,What else you got?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,No.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,Au contraire.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"So, I win."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"Darn tootin’, I win."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called."
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Say what?
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
2,20,The Hofstadter Isotope,Leonard,"Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,You got it.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Alright, back to the game."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you’re ready."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I don’t like this game.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,We were up to you.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going to guess."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"You know, I’m given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"I’ve never been there, have you?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Thank you. Hello, neighbour."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,And how are you doing this fine evening?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Good. I’m glad.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Oh, I shall. (Sings Superman theme while searching his pockets.) No!"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Howard, could I borrow some after shave?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,That is a lot of cologne.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Come on, let’s go."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Alright.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on the moon."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I left them in the bowl.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Where?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,What’s it doing in my apartment?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Yeah, I really need to talk to you."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,You think that’d help?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind of guy."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"So, how was your day?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all, just eat."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,I think she knows what I meant.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,How can one person be a whole movie?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Hmm, I see."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Can you?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language…"
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Thank you, that’s very helpful."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Behold?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From Cornwall."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there’s no room for my big Cornish head."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,May I say one last thing.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Alright. Goodnight.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,"Hey, how’s it going."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,Yes.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Penny.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I can’t sleep. how are you going?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I’m homesick.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter. It’s in a galaxy far, far away."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Sing soft kitty.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Homesick is a type of being sick.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Sleepy kitty.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,No. Start over.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Penny.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,Thank you for letting me stay here.
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re finally home."
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Leonard,What were you doing at Penny’s?
2,21,The Vegas Renormalization,Sheldon,"Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Smell that? That’s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, spoiler alert."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"You told me it’s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,Said the Grinch to Christmas.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, sure, what’s up?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, vaguely."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,What about it?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Why the hell not?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Nobody wants that.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, or you call me."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Or nobody calls anyone.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,I’m listening.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Good, good. You?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Sure.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Yes.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,About what?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"No, no that’s the past. I’m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ’cause, well, that’s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn’t bother me."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, well I wouldn’t say cool, I’d just say, that’s Leonard!"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,About Stuart? Love to.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Well, uh, first of all, don’t underestimate the value of discomfort."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that’s why he works in a comic book store."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Oh. It’s Stuart.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,You’re not going to answer it?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,He wants to talk about Penny. I don’t want to talk about Penny.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"You’re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Why would he call me?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"We don’t know. And if you don’t answer the phone, we can’t know."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"I’m not answering the phone, Sheldon."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Answer the phone, Leonard."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"No! There, it went to voice mail."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to check your messages?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,No.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,It must be hell inside your head.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,At times.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,How teeny tiny?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,But the mission is for six months.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,Have you notified NASA?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"So, what do you need us for?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,I agree. It’s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Good one.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. (There is a knock on the door)"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Hey Stuart.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Um…
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a regular Manhattan Project. What’s up?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m sorry, it’s been broken."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, that too. Everything’s broken."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don’t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, like, you’re afraid that if you touch her, she’ll break."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,It wasn’t bad advice. It just wasn’t particularly helpful.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"For what it’s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,I feel terrible.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart’s date with Penny.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"You don’t really believe in that superstition, do you?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,It won’t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,It won’t work. No way to mount it.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,That could work.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Morning.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I’m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Great. So how’d it go with Stuart last night?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Okay… I just… I kind of…
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,You’re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you’re building.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn’t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Comic book store.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,Why does Leonard get to go?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"‘Cause he’s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I’m going to kick him in his ovaries."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, Howard."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master’s degree."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,Fascinating.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,It was?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,You’re kidding. Never worked for me.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Wine? I didn’t say to give her wine.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Leonard?
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I’m sorry. That must’ve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I’m sorry it didn’t work out."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yeah, how about that? See you soon."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,Howard’s space toilet. I’ll tell you later.
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Sheldon,"I don’t see why I have to worry. My career’s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It’s funny, because it’s true."
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"I’m sorry, were you talking to me?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,"Yes, you did, didn’t you?"
2,22,The Classified Materials Turbulence,Leonard,What was it doing on the ceiling?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, boy."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,What?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,I can’t comment without violating our agreement that I don’t criticize your work.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Then what was oh, boy?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Great restraint on my part.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,There’s nothing wrong with the science here.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Why?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,It doesn’t say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"That’s 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I’m effectively one of Heisenberg’s particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I’m going, but I can’t know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s two o’clock in the morning."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Everybody?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,You went to President Seibert’s house in the middle of the night?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"He didn’t respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I’m talking to."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Okay, well, do you want to go?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Maybe.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I’m on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Easy peasy, I’m doing it right now."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I’m not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can’t go."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Well, then don’t go."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"All right, then go."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,How was it resolved?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted…"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,…the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,It’s not gonna be the same without you.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I’ll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I’ll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Hang on. Let’s talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don’t know how we can turn it down.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Yes.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,I’m in.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition’s team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don’t worry, there will be a briefing."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,I need access to the Cheesecake Factory’s walk-in freezer.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I’m going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Yes.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Hi.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Actually, it would help."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Yeah.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Did she seem upset to you?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,No. Did she seem upset to you?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,No.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,A little bit.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Two for two. I’m on fire.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"I mean, I know she’s not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn’t you think she’d feel a little bad that I’m going to be gone for the whole summer?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"That feels like a bonus question. I’m going to stop here while I’m ahead, but I’ve had a great time."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,And begin.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"I can’t press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Okay, I can’t do this."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Hang on, I know I don’t possess the tools of leadership, but I don’t understand why we can’t assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,I hadn’t thought of that. I guess we’re done here.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Here, drink slash eat this."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,What is it?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,It’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, you know I can’t eat butter. I’m lactose intolerant."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Way ahead of you, that’s an “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” stick."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"That’s very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it’ll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sure, but let’s go out here where there’s a little less yelling and guilt. What’s up?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Oh, a blanket."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Oh, wow, cool."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Bye.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, Sheldon?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"I want a cookie, Meemaw."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Sheldon, it’s me."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,But Meemaw just made cookies.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Listen, I don’t know if I can go on the expedition."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,What?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,I don’t think I can go to the North Pole.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Okay, Leonard, I know you’re concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s very comforting."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Comforting is a part of leadership. It’s not a part I care for, but such is my burden."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Terrific, it’s just that I don’t think Penny wants me to go."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Assuming that’s a valid reason not to go, which it isn’t, how do you know this? Did she say it?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,What is it?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,It’s a blanket with sleeves.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yes, obviously."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Yes, okay, but I’m gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn’t miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,She does have a short attention span.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"So, I can’t go."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,You really think so?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"It’s 7 a.m. I’m sorry it’s early, but we’re leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,What did you mean when you said you’re going to miss me?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Glad we cleared that up.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,I guess I’ll see you.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Thank you. Bye.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Damn it.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,We’re out of ice.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,It is remarkable.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Dinner’s ready!
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,What are we having?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Reconstituted Thai food.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Check.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,Check.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,"Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Leonard,"Uh, oh, sorry."
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You’re in my spot.
2,23,The Monopolar Expedition,Sheldon,Three months. This is gonna be great!
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, thank God we’re home."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"I don’t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I’d call you when I got home, I’m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I’m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I’m all but certain there’s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn’t say that. I’m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,I’m going to go let Penny know we’re back.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy’s home."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, I just stopped by to say… (she grabs him and kisses him) Yeah, so, hi!"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won’t forget your contributions."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Of course, I can’t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Tell me what?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"You fellows are planning a party for me, aren’t you?"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"If there’s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don’t care for luau, toga or under the sea."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"If this is about the night the heat went out, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,You tampered with my experiment?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Did Leonard know about this? Leonard’s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn’t know.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"I missed you, too."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I realize you’re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"What’s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,It was the only way to make him happy.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I’ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man’s understanding of the universe."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"You’re right, Leonard, it’s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, I feel terrible."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Man, I cannot catch a break."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn’t even get to go to Comic-Con!
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,That’s for when I’m sick. Sad is not sick.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,I don’t have a sad song. I’m not a child.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Howard…
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Come on. We said we were sorry.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s going to take more than I’m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you’ve done to me.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"All right, I’ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I’ m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,My credibility may have been damaged…
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"But I would like to remind you that in science, there’s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man’s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… (she kisses him)"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Man, I can not catch a break."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Really?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Maybe you can.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Aw, Mom."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Fed.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Bread.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Grateful.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Plateful.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,They’re not my friends.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that’s why they hated me.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Saloons?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Will you please take that stupid hat off?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,– We took the red-eye.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, no, thank you."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yes, ma’am."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,What are they doing here?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,We came to apologize.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Evolution isn’t an opinion, it’s fact."
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Sheldon,I forgive you. Let’s go home.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,How about that? I finally caught a break.
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Why does it have to get weird?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,"I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…"
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Yeah?
3,1,The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation,Leonard,Totally.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Hey, guys."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"There’s more to life than sex, Raj."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I did.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Sheldon, dinner’s here."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Tandoori Palace?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"No, we went somewhere new."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"No, look, Mumbai Palace."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Trust me, this will be just fine."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,What’s that supposed to mean?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,I don’t know
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Please don’t be mad.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Okay?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"So, you’ve been through this before?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Okay-dokay.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,So much.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I can’t take your money.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Thank God.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"All right, you have a wager."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,More wine?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I don’t see anything.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Help me open it.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,What are we drinking now?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,What?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"God, I had the most horrible night."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave)"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I’m sorry?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Told you.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Penny, I’d rather not talk about it."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Why would that make me feel better?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Well, I wish I could."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Hello.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Hey. What’s going on?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz."
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Yes.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Interesting.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Hardly.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Excuse me.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,Have I crossed some sort of line again?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Little bit. (Exits)
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Sheldon,"Hmm. Oh, who cares?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,Is that what you want?
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,I guess.
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"It would, wouldn’t it?"
3,2,The Jiminy Conjecture,Leonard,"Good, good."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,No.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,It’s Oatmeal Day.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Morning.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"No, her bed kind of… broke."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Perfectly formed miniature human being.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Don’t do that.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,I want oatmeal.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,It’s a… (gives up)
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it’s Monday."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Wow!
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Come on, you guys, let it go."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,What was that?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"It does. But in my experience, you don’t."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Howard, what did you do?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Why are you carrying extras?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"In this case, you bet she is."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Did you? I didn’t notice. Have a chocolate.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"And it’s not a cartoon, it’s anime."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,You’re here a lot now.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Thank you. Chocolate?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Okay, I know what you’re doing."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Really?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Very good. Chocolate?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Actually, it turns out I can."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Well, you shouldn’t."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"There’s just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren’t happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"No, this has to stop now."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"I’m not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the “bazinga” was implied. I’m just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"No, you’re not sanding Penny."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Are you saying that I’m forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Yes, you’re forbidden."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,No.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"No, of course not. We’re talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Forget it.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"I’m not. And Penny’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Yes.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,You’re not changing how Penny laughs.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Come again?
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Have a chocolate.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you’ll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth)
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Unbelievable.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,"Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late."
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Leonard,Let’s go.
3,3,The Gothowitz Deviation,Sheldon,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,What do you mean?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Hey.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,The parade.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,What’s he on trial for?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Oh. I’ll be there.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"So, what’s going on with Raj?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"What do you mean, he’s getting deported?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"So, what’s going on?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,And you’ve continued to take the university’s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Don’t worry, you’ll find another job."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Forgive me, as you know, I’m no adept at reading facial cues, but I’m going to take a stab here, you’re either sad or nauseated."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I was going to say sad. I don’t know why I hedged.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I’m sorry.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,And you’re wrong about Hinduism and cows.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"That’s happy, right?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Yeah.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Nailed it.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Hey.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he’s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit…"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, if you didn’t cheer at my entrance, it’s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,For me. You’re going to have to listen more carefully when you’re on the job.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,For me.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Of course I’m busy.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,For me.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I’m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I reject them all.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I believe you’ve misunderstood. I’m not giving you the job. I’m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we’ll get started with the interview."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Please.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"So, that’s what you wear to an interview?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Bazinga! You’ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I’m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,What are you thinking?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,You are a dirty girl.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Hi, Howard."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Uh-huh.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"You know, whatever."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"All right, we’re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I’m the boss. I make the jokes.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"This is not the time for joking. We’re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,What?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Top desk drawer.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Alright?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Good.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,That was fun. Thank you.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,What are you doing here?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,"Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Good.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Are you sure?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Leonard,Okay. Howard come back.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Astro means star.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,English is your native language.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Caca?
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"In this context, with me means for me."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Oh! If I’m wrong, prove it."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"No, no, no, you’ve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,You’re defacing my work.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,Give me the eraser.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I said give it to me.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!"
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I am in every way.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you’ve made your point."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I didn’t say that.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I didn’t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,In this context for me could mean with me.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I reject them all.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"Wait, you have to drive me home."
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,I walked.
3,4,The Pirate Solution,Sheldon,"I can’t. There’s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Just play a potion card.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Sheldon, don’t ruin the game."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,See? Ruined.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Why?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,What?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Yeah, I don’t remember that."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Howard, you can’t hold me to that."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, no."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do for you today. (Leonard steals a napkin) Good luck. That’s the face napkin."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"No, I haven’t."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Right.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,I’ll see what I can do.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,That would probably save us some time.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,I have money.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,How does it different from the money I have?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Over puppets?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,But I must have it.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"From hell’s heart, I stab at thee."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Another delightful surprise for her.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition’s flames!"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Silence!
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Gonna be a long night.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,"Long, long night."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’"
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,How about that? Einstein was wrong.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Leonard,Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Luminescence spell.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Fire demon.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Three-headed lion.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Brimstone.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"Oh, yes."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,I can’t.
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,"No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny."
3,5,The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary,Sheldon,I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Kites, ho!"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,You want to come watch?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh. Football, sure."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, great."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Well, this sucks."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, that certainly would suck."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Sorry.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Victory!
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it in front of you."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, how kind of her."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite. I have your kite."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Hey.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,How was your football party?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Another football game?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Did not know that.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Great.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Sacks, sacks…"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Huh… Scrimmage…
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Oh.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Apparently.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Unbelievable.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"If you’re interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,So you could teach me?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Football or chicken-fried meats?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Please, I’m asking you as a friend."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Yes.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Fine.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,I really appreciate this.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,I’m sorry?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"That’s how my father always began our football conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing to watch football at Penny’s?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,What’s wrong with a football jersey?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Anyway, wish me luck."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,How would you put it?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, okay, like you said."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Good-Bye, Sheldon."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,What’s funny about Cylon toast?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Oh. Did not know that.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"None, why?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Okay, yeah. I can see the difference."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of bread."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Mimesis?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,What the hell are you talking about?
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, I guess so."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,"Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Sheldon,I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, you’re kidding me."
3,6,The Cornhusker Vortex,Leonard,Nice meeting all of you.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,We must not be playing it right.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Why not?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Wait. What are you talking about?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Who is this Justin?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Your turn, Leonard."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"No, you didn’t."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Roll the dice, Leonard."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I’ll just roll for you.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,What was your first clue?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,It’s also your roll.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"No, we just had a little spat."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Leonard! Stop the car!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,What?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Come on, come on, we’re late."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Calm down, we’ll make the movie."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Go, go, Power Rangers, go!"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Just give us a minute.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"So, are we going to talk about last night?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,No.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on. This is stupid."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Got it.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Thank you!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,I am not going to fold.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Yes.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Yes.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Hey.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Sure.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Go apologize to Penny.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,What?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Right now would be good.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Why didn’t you say so?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Thank you.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I want that one.
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,"Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,"Can I get this comic book, too?"
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Leonard,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
3,7,The Guitarist Amplification,Sheldon,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Oh, hey. Dune."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,Too bad Sheldon couldn’t come with us.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Sheldon’s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m going to be dining alone this evening, so I’ll be reducing my usual order. I’d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven’s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny’s door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Penny?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"(At Penny’s bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Shall I come back at a better time?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Hello.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Tubs are slippery.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,They’re holding umbrellas.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,The ducks in my tub.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"They’re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, assuming you’re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,I don’t drive.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, it seems we’ve reached an impasse."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"I wish Penny didn’t have to work, she loves camping."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Mmmm, not bad."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"That doesn’t mean one won’t be in another, especially if I’m driving."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Okay, here."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All right.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,We should have you checked for a concussion.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All right.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Don’t look?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, that’s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,They always look. It never ends well.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Ok.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,It doesn’t feel like an arm.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All righty.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Stars are pretty, aren’t they?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,Better. Thanks.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,What’s so funny?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Didn’t work out well.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"One moment. According to my driver’s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There’s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Where is the passenger side mirror?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I’m going to have to start again."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, I think we’re going sufficiently fast. What’s that?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"That can’t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise’s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"No, it isn’t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,No. That was the last pudding cup.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Oh, god, I am so hungry."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,Okay.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"All right, there’s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,All right. And how did the accident occur?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Kidney disease?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Migraines?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Are you currently pregnant?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,When was your last menstrual period?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"I’ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Possible Tourette’s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. There, there. Everything’s going to be fine. Sheldon’s here."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,What kind of score are we looking at?
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"All right, everyone grab flashlights."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,"Quick, get forks."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Leonard,I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don’t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,"That’s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it."
3,8,The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,Sheldon,“Soft Kitty” is for when you’re sick. You’re not sick.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,He struck out.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Never mind, what’s your announcement?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know…"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,My thank you was not sincere.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Are you really going to be on NPR?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Very cool, congratulations."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Hey.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,Hello.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Excuse me, I’m sitting here."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Again, I’m right here."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"I am here, right? You see me."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, may I interject?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"My pleasure, Ira."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"How ya doin’, buddy?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I’m doing?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Come on, it wasn’t that bad."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,What do you want?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,It wasn’t funny.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Raj.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,Did you laugh?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,I refuse to sink to his level.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Are you really admitting defeat?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,I never admit defeat.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Good.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,You’re not helping.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"No, no."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even though he’s not."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Let’s keep thinking.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"You flatter me, sir."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"Let me guess, motion sensors?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,"I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,Who is that with him?
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,There is no abort.
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Sheldon,"I made a boo-boo, all right?"
3,9,The Vengeance Formulation,Leonard,At least they don’t know it was you.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Leonard, she’s doing it again."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Leonard.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Hello.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,Yeah. Hey.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Sure. The more, the merrier."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,Sheldon…
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,That’s where Sheldon sits.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,My mother was right. Hell is real.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,I am. Are you interested in physics?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Howard?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Bazinga. I don’t care.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Just need a little more practice.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go through that again."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Then speak.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but she asked for privacy."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Why can’t Leonard teach you?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example, I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,The one with the frogs.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I got it."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,You’re welcome to come.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,Excuse me?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,Yeah? So?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,What are you talking about?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,Has it ever worked?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,I believe you.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve extended a friendly casual greeting.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where’s your notebook?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too intimidating.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Can’t you hold it?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,I’m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Greece.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA equals MG?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,No.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,No.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Oh!
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,Why are you crying?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,A good question.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,"And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Sheldon,It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,What did I do now?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,What?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,What was I supposed to tell her?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,And what would that be?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,You told her my experiment was stupid?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Should I, um, leave you two alone?"
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,We’re shocked.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,"Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now."
3,10,The Gorilla Experiment,Leonard,I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Here we go.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Merry Newton-mas, everyone."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"No, he doesn’t."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Tomorrow.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Um, tomorrow?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Well, I just, I thought…"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"You are, it’s just…"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"I know. And those specials, they change every day."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Okay, sorry."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Um…
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Um…
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Um…
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,No trouble at all.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"I drove, Mother. I’m driving now."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,You did.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Neither do I, but it’s the social convention."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"No, I heard that."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Fine, Mom. How are you?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Now I’m less fine.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,You must be very happy.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Not the time, Sheldon."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,What?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,No!
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,When did this happen?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,September 22nd.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Mitzy’s dead?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,What is it?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I made tea.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I don’t want tea.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Then why are you telling me?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,It’s a conversation starter.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,That’s a lousy conversation starter.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I want that too. Why are you here?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Thank you, that’s very comforting."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,That’s not the comforting part.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,It’s not?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"You’re right, I do feel better."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,You’re my surrogate family?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,"If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,Are you guys drunk?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I do.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,You’re very welcome.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,I blame Penny.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Sheldon,Agreed.
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"What the hell, agreed."
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,"Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?"
3,11,The Maternal Congruence,Leonard,I’m over it.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I don’t understand. What other kind of women are there?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"What are you trying to tell me, Howard?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Got it.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Detailed analysis posted online.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,How did we get actual women?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"It is great, isn’t it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I just discovered I don’t have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"All right. Well, I’m going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that’s linked to race riots in the 1940s."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,The zoot suit riots.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,That’s a semantically null sentence.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, that’s certainly amusing, but I have no interest."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott’s mathematical fantasy, Flatland."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,You’re only saying that because you haven’t been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Is that you, Raj? I don’t recognize your edge."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, you’re in luck, there’s a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there’s a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Tell her you’re a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"I hope you’re hungry, Bernadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Great. How come?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Of course, I would never make fun of you."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Penny."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I don’t drink.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I would like a root beer float.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"They don’t? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,And don’t be chintzy with the Shirley.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,All right. There’s a female.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,But she’s female. Isn’t that the game?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Okay. What is your game?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,It’s a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I’m Sheldon. How do you do?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I’m sorry. (Smiles and nods)
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Hello.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"I’m sorry, but facts are facts."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with… (she shuts the door in his face) Want your fish? (Opens door, takes fish, closes it again) I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. (Opens his own apartment door to find Sheldon, Raj and the two girls playing Rock Band and performing American Woman)"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,What’s going on?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,We scored. I’m the wingman.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,What the hell is eighth base?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Oh, couldn’t be better."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,And that didn’t bother you?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Penny?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howard."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,What is that?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,The dog… koira. The roof… katto. Grapes… ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. Sis  n.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"It means come in. It’s taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I’d learn Finnish."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,I don’t say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you’ve gone insane.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That’s done, I’ve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I’m not going to learn Finnish again."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or… vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Oh, my. I’ve admired these for years."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Hulk sad.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Okay, let’s go see your psychic."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,Great.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Leonard,"Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that’s going to completely change my visits there. Well, it’s late."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Time for bed.
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves)."
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,Yes?
3,12,The Psychic Vortex,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose. Come in. I’ll sleep in Leonard’s room. Good night."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,So what? It’s the same food.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso’s Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It’s now under chicken."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, General Tso."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,It’s obviously a typo.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant’s now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Good idea. We’ll go to Corleone’s.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn’t possibly contain chunks of mobster."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,And why is that?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,It was listed under seafood.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,The TV is gone.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,So are our laptops.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It’s all right. They didn’t take my comic books."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,We like games.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,When does the CSI team get here?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"In anticipation of their arrival, I’ve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,What about me?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, Leonard. It’s too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, that’s the end of your inquiry?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,How is that going to help them?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,What are we supposed to do now?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, how I wish I could."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Hand me the bat.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"We’re fine, Sheldon."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"All right, then. Good night."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Mm-hmm.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,May I come in?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I see you’re drinking wine.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don’t think the two of you’d be comfortable on the couch."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,What do you want?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"It’s not what I want, it’s what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,But you don’t like other people.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I do tonight. It’s scary over there.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"It’s getting scary here, too."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Did we win? Can we go to bed?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"He’s right, Penny. It’s all there."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,All right. I’ll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Great. Good night.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,4am.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Just keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone)
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Bad idea.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Listen to her, Jim."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Who is it?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,What if they cut the power?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,What if someone steals my keys?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Where did you get all this stuff?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,He just gave it to you?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Sorry, let me help you."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Wonderful security system if we’re attacked by a school of tuna.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Better.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Sheldon’s journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I’ve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard’s window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I heard a noise.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Why would you knock over a lamp?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,We were going to have…
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh! No, she’s right, I don’t need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,What are you doing? Use the door.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Good thinking. Perhaps I’ll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Great, you do that."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,I’m lactose intolerant.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"And you don’t wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Sorry about that.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I’m fine. Although I’m no longer the master of my own bladder.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don’t like that.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I’m leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that’s overreacting."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan’l Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you’re from Nebraska, correct?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,"Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"I sense you’re making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,I am moving on. I’m going to be a Bozite.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Leonard,They call themselves Bozites?
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,They should. It’s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Please, Penny, as you know, I’m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!"
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,"Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please."
3,13,The Bozeman Reaction,Sheldon,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Is it morning?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Then I’ve been up all night.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Aye, aye, Captain."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Maybe you need a fresh start.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"You’re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass…"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"No, I think it’s a firmware problem."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Structure, constant structure. One atom…"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Not lima beans, carbon atoms."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Here, you want my peas?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"You had some nice moves out there, Howard."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, my God! Are you… (falls as well)"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Are you okay?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Don’t bark at me. I fell, too."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t I?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"No, that’s a crazy thing."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Impaired cognitive function.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,But I don’t want to go to bed.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, all right."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,That was amazing how you handled him.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Thanks for not calling the cops.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,But I’m still working.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"You can try, but you’ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,What?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I have good news.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Your cell phone was off.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"And that didn’t work out, did it?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,What are you talking about?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Einstein.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, I’m going to need a little more."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Albert Einstein.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Keep going.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Sounds like a great plan.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Told you.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,A menial job. Like yours.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Shouldn’t you check your database?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,You didn’t really type.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I could do that.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,One question.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,What’s sheetrock?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,That seems acceptable.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I don’t drive.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon. I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,"All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appétit."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Yes.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Double guacamole?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Of course.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,No cilantro?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Nope.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,Yep.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,You understand why I’m doing this to you?
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I do.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,That’ll be all. That was fun.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,Sheldon took our order.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either."
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t work here.
3,14,The Einstein Approximation,Leonard,"Sheldon, come here."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Actually, he might have to. There’s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it’s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Who’s miserable and alone?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn’t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one’s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,That’s not what I was going to tell you.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn’t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"This is incredible! I’m so happy, I’m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I’m just going to run home and start packing."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,I am taking Penny.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, you got a minute?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Penny.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,What? That’s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"I’m sorry, Sheldon."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Sorry? I’ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Shame on you! That’s no dream for a scientist!
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Uh-huh.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,How does that involve air travel?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,No.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Penny."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Not the roommate agreement.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Oh, for God’s sakes."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"He can’t kill me, even if I turn."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"No, that seemed a little farfetched."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"I’ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don’t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,No.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Look, Sheldon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Is that your final decision?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,It is.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Very well.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon’s bedroom.)
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,You’re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Rupert Murdoch?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,You seen Sheldon?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Seriously?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Morning, old chum."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,What’s going on?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"I’ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here’s Frodo."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,You made Frodo pancakes?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Why are you doing this?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,It’s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I’ve had some time to reflect and I’ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It’s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Thanks. It’s good.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"What you’re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you’ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,You hate Babylon 5.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it’s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you’re my friend."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Drat. No Frodo for you.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Hello.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Alright, let’s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I’m here."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I’m here in the laundry room."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let’s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"No, it’s not. I’ve got five more slides."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Very well. Enjoy yourself. You’re going to be in the presence of something that I’ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you’ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,You will?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Since I rarely hug, I’m relying on your expertise regarding duration."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Oh, good. Bye-bye."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, I need to talk to you."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Some what?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Cholermus. It’s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I’m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,You’re not going to Switzerland!
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Oh, but I am. Didn’t Penny tell you the good news?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Yes, that good news."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Penny, not you!"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Really?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yeah, really."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,I’m sorry you feel that way.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"I don’t think you’re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Why don’t you enlighten me?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates’ house should I be invited.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Oh!
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Not really, I’m just an enthusiast."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,Penny? You okay?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,What’s going on?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)"
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Great. I’ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it’s the cholermus."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Chicken?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,With the little stars?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,Heated to 180 degrees?
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Sheldon,"Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."
3,15,The Large Hadron Collision,Leonard,"Yeah, I forgot about all this."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Will you please turn your shirt off?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. (Raj presses his iPod. The theme from Jeopardy plays.) Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass? (Presses again, his shirt blows a raspberry.)"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Stan Lee.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"No, no, Stan Lee."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"You have no idea who he is, do you?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Nope.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,No.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,That’s Bruce Lee.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,It bothers me.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,A summons for what?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Yes, it is."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that’s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,So you betrayed me?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I’m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I’m guilty.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"I am not guilty. I only have a learner’s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"You don’t need to reimburse me because I’m not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I’m going to begin preparing my defence right now."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Now you see what you’ve done? Because of you, we’re all going to miss Stan Lee."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Whoa! What do you mean all?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, you’re my friends. You’ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I’m victorious."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, okay. No."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,That’s what I’m saying.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Howard?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Raj? You’ll be there, won’t you? (Shirt plays “incorrect” quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it’ll just be me and my eyewitness."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Please try to wear something appropriate. It won’t help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,That’s just wrong.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I’d like to call on your skills as an actress."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"I’ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let’s face it, you’re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don’t worry, it’s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Excellent. Go on.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,And who performed that heroic act?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"There’s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Thank you.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I object. You’re completely ignoring the law.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,That’s my spot.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, come on, why would you do that?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Sheldon’s in jail?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,For what?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,So tell him to apologize.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I need to use the restroom.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,That’s the toilet?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,Please tell the judge I’m ready to apologize.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,You know very well how it went.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,I was found guilty and fined $533.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"I also now have three points on a driver’s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,"Okay, that’s enough, Howard. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,You had gelato with Stan Lee?
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Leonard,Except for Raj.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, I hope you’re satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"This is Stan Lee’s front door. We were on Stan Lee’s curb, then we were on Stan Lee’s walk, and now we’re at Stan Lee’s front door."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee’s doorbell. At Stan Lee’s house. We’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,We’re not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,You said we were invited.
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, I’m not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"I’ll tell you where I’ve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
3,16,The Excelsior Acquisition,Sheldon,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Well, it’s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I’m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Don’t panic, this is better."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Who’s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"No, what’s sad is that you don’t know Adam West was TV’s Batman."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Okay, bye."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Fascinating.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,What?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Oh.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,It’s not Elvish. It’s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,And in the darkness bind them.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Seedy underbelly?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"If you’re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,How is this maritime salvage?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"We can’t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,You mean my ring?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,What are you doing?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Give me that.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I found it. The ring is mine. I don’t understand why in this group I never get my way.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,You always get your way.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I’ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,This ring.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Looking for something?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,How am I looking now?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Ow! You hit me! I’m bleeding!
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,What was that?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,That’s my girl.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"It’s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I’d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I’d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,No.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,No Jet Skis.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men’s room.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Give me that.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"No, it’s mine."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"I’m not letting go, you let go."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"All right, it starts now."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Oh, crap!"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.)
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Thank you.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,I’m out.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don’t you go after Raj’s mother?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you’d like to add?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,No! I call no Meemaws.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I don’t want to hear this.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Never.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Stop it!
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I said stop it!
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Waterfalls!
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Subliminal messaging. I’m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Oh-ho-ho, it’s working all right. I have to pee."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,"I’ve done it! I’ve won! The ring is mine! It’s mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We’re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where’s the ring?"
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,"There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious."
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Sheldon,I knew it. Give us the precious!
3,17,The Precious Fragmentation,Leonard,NEVER!
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I won?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,You won.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,What?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can’t give a speech.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"What, to you, is a large crowd?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I’m not accepting the award.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it… oh, dear. (He faints.)"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Don’t trample me.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes, I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Sit down, we want to talk to you."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,We think we can help you with your stage fright.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m much smarter than all of you."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I do like the X-Men.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your powers?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,And I appreciate the pretence.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"And yet, you can’t speak to women."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Okay, but don’t punch me."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,That’s what my sister used to say.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Proceed.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,It’s only one colour.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,That’s a lot of money for only one colour.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit). This is pretty sharp.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,In the prom department.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"So, Sheldon, how you doing?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’ll start again."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Um, I don’t know, maybe."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I was wearing size a million pants.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,Why don’t we just talk?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,And how did that make you feel?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Go on.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Thank you, Leonard."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,For what?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… (continues as background noise)"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I’m getting dizzy.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,I’m ready.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I’m having about the events of last night?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Question one, where are my pants?"
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,You might want to check YouTube.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,What do I search?
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating."
3,18,The Pants Alternative,Leonard,"Uh-uh, give it a minute."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Did you just quote Star Wars?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Good. Glad is good.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, probably."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Good night.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone levels."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I honestly don’t care.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"For the record, giant rats are possible."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"No, there was no spat."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear about it. Excuse me.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,What? No.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,No.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,No.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I’m walking away from you now.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o’clock."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Remember, seven o’clock."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Pacific Daylight time!
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,These are my own bowling shoes.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,I know where my feet have been.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny’s pretty good."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Chilli cheese fry?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Really? You love them?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,How can you not be sure?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I am not pushing anything.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,This is for you.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch with Stuart’s team for tonight.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the captain, I can do that."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,When are you going to talk to him?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, I do."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake here."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the Wesley “Crushers.”
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"No, it’s not the… Never mind."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,All right.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,I so loathe you.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,That’s not even from your franchise!
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Be the ball, Howard."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,You weren’t the ball.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"This is fun, huh?"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I am currently the ball.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above playing the dead meemaw card."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Penny, you’re up."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the ball."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,We really need a strike here.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,So just take your time and concentrate.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I’m not pressuring you.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get you ice cream!"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,"No, let her go."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Leonard,I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"You did this, didn’t you?"
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,"No, I suppose not."
3,19,The Wheaton Recurrence,Sheldon,Wheaton!
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Uh-oh.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I was going to get my mail.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute intercourse."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Bazinga.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made Jesus eat."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m hungry now.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment)."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I was talking with Penny.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Which one picks last?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless there’s a kid in a wheelchair."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Okay.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"So, you guys want to do something tonight?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"What about you, Raj?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I never stopped hanging out with you.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my after-dinner walk."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I can’t think of a reason why not.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Hold on. Nope, no reason."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"All right, say hello to your mother for me."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,What?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I didn’t say outside.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Which way are you going?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m going the other way. Bye.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I shall. Have a nice scoot.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Yeah?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Where you going with this, Raj?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"So, go."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,And you think my presence will help with that?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"I’m not going out tonight, Raj."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Very much.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out over you.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t supposed to mention."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Do you have a stomach ache, too?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,No.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, my new shoes are not made for running."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,You can’t cook and you made me this.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"I told you, walking."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,For an hour and a half?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I got lost.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Satellites are down. Solar flares.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,What the hell was that about?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, we really need to get you a girl."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, just come in!"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Maybe this isn’t a good time.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,What do you want?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,You may want to sit down.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I’m in bed!
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,Point taken. You may want to sit up.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Sheldon!
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Penny."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Yes.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I guess not.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,You used to it yet?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,His mother?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I was going to do that.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I just took him for shoes.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,You’re taking him to Disneyland?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,I was going to see that with him.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,I can still eat.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Okay, but just don’t fight"
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,We’re not fighting.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Want a cup of coffee?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,What am I smelling?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,"Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
3,20,The Spaghetti Catalyst,Leonard,Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Hold.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Explain your sneeze.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Do you have allergies?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Is there too much pepper on your salad?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,I’ve heard enough. Sit over there.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"That’s what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You’re on your own."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Sarcasm?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"For your information, I’ll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We’ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she’s under consideration for a position at our university."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"I didn’t realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you’re a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I’ve been to Toronto."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"My room, of course."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Go ahead.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"When I’ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you’ll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"I’m not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. This isn’t about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Hello.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonard, I live"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,I apologize. He’s only an experimental physicist.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"No, she’s my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Look, it’s you."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"No, he doesn’t understand. I understand."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Well, I understand, too."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,You’re just misappropriating my understanding.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Oh, (blows a raspberry). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Get it together, man."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There’s a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"In here, you’ll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Then there’s really no reason to live, is there?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"He’s an odd duck, isn’t he?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That’s why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you’ll find in the bathroom. They’re in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Good. I’ll leave you to your night time ablutions. I’ve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You’ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It’s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Sleep well, my friend."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Oh, let me just get one thing. It’s my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn’t pass through here. Now, good night. And if there’s an apocalypse, good luck."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Yes?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Is everything all right?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Uh, six."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Sure.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Wow. You really make science come alive.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Morning.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I’m going to relieve myself."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,How do you take your coffee?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Okeydoke.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Something his mother taught him.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Ah, so the yogurt didn’t work. I’ll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard’s bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"I, um, I don’t follow."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Well, now…"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. I’m uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"That’s preposterous. Tell her, Leonard."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Well…
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,No.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Penny, I can still drive you."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"I must say, I’m shocked by this betrayal."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,I didn’t betray Penny.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Not Penny, me!"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,How am I betraying you?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Elizabeth’s my friend, and you’re playing with her!"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I guess I did."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,You still have a cold?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"No, but I was awake all night."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,No.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,No.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"Dr. Plimpton, I’d like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Sheldon,"And of course, you’ve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Hey, you."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Sure. Black, right?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Coming right up.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Hey, who’s ready for Halo?"
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,I don’t understand.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Elizabeth? What’s going on?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,I thought we had something special.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,Hey.
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I wanted to explain."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,I don’t?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,So you’re not judging me?
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,"Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did."
3,21,The Plimpton Stimulation,Leonard,She let me.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,(voice off): Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,(voice off): This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,"(voice off): No, you don’t screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,"(voice off): I don’t have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, I’m there already!"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,Leonard.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"You heard that, huh?"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"So you agree, he’s nuts."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago. (Flasback: The lobby) I’d just started at the university.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,That should have been my first clue.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"In retrospect, that was clue number two."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. (Flashback: The apartment)"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard’s bedroom.)"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,Do I get some sympathy now?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,I’m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. (Flashback.)"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,"Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,Hey.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,There’s doubt?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,"That’s not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m sorry."
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,There you go.
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,"So, we’re good?"
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,Good what?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Leonard,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
3,22,The Staircase Implementation,Sheldon,Go ahead.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Okay, we’ve got power to the laser."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I should’ve brought an umbrella.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,What for? It’s not going to rain.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"One of my best, don’t you think?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Relax, it’s just a dirty sock."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Not my world.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"I wasn’t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Your company?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"So, menus."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Hello.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin’."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,The laser?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"See, now this is a man for Penny."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Uh, that’s a great question, Zack."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"No, it’s not."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Well it’s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we’re going to blow up the moon? That’s a great question.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Make it so.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I was wrong. Penny can do better.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,He must be very skilled at coitus.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"No, thanks."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Have they found a match for you?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I can’t bring the nitrogen tank down.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Why not?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"All right, let me restate that. It’s very heavy, and I don’t want to."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,I’ll help you.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Coming!
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Are you drunk?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,How did I ruin him?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Come on, he wasn’t that stupid."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, he’s stupid."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,How is that my fault?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Where are we going?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Why? I mean, okay."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,What’s going on?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Oh! Not this again.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I’m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"As a native Texan, I must say I’ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, God. That I’ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Counting this instance? 317.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Where’s Penny?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I have no difficulty believing you’re not butter.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Oh, hey."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can’t do it."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Uh, I know! It’s been a while!"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Right. Right. So how you doing?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,She’s not coming back.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Who’s going to tell whom about what?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Be more specific.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,That’s not afternoon. That’s preevning.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,It’s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I’m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Well, tomorrow’s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I’ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it’s wondering why I’m having this conversation with you."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,He didn’t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,I don’t drink coffee.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,What’s life without whimsy?
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,You’re bluffing.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Curse you.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,Thirty feet.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,"Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Leonard,I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Haughty derision it is.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I’m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I’m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,"Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas."
3,23,The Lunar Excitation,Sheldon,May I buy you a beverage?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,Alright.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Impressive, but we must be cautious."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Today, it’s a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,No one ever does. That’s why it happens.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,So how’s work?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Yeah, we all are."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I wouldn’t say amazing. At best, it’s a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Yes? (Howard types. The hand puts up two fingers to Sheldon.) Peace?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,His girlfriend.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,Four months.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Yes, Penny."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Why on Earth would we have sex?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I’m quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,Still digging the Shamy?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,You mean dating?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I can’t date Amy.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,She’s not my girlfriend.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Oh. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don’t think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"If you’re looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we’re having right now."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I’ve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Wait. You have to drive me.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,You know I don’t drive.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Actually, I’m paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I’m uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Now.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Hurry. We’re going to be late.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. Do you have other plans?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Thank you for driving me.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I wish you weren’t wearing flip-flops. It’s dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Sorry. I just don’t want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Then, this is my first date."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I have a master’s degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,Yeah?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,What?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Don’t bother. I’ve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Oh, no, I wouldn’t care for that. Amy?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,No.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,All right. It was hell.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Muggles.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Okay, let’s see."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Well, then let’s un-pause it."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,How about an acetylene torch?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Well, then what do you want us to do?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"You have any ideas, Raj?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It’s over 14 hours in Southern California.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Thank you.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn’t count."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I’ve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15…"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. 16?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Based on the number of awkward encounters I’ve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before…"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I should think so.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Okay, come on. Almost there."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Excuse me, could you help us out?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Uh, it’s what controls the arm."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"I’ll be happy to check the math, but numbers don’t lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"In these uncertain times, doesn’t humanity deserve a gift?"
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,That’s no threat. My mother’s always wanted a grandchild.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,Curses.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,"Well, it’s not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night."
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Sheldon,I’ve decided not to procreate.
4,1,The Robotic Manipulation,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Yes.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Yes.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Killed by badger.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,How’s that?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,You can always get a badger and find out.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"That long, huh?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,What’s there?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,By this much.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Tough break. You want eggs?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,What’s a dogapus?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Is somebody working on that?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Thank you.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Never mind. I got it.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,It’s no big deal.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Hmm? How much you got?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,How can you walk around with no money?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"It’s okay, you can owe me."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, six bucks."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,It’s a small price to pay.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"No, no, don’t ask."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Correct.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Essentially, yes."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,What the hell? What’s the matter?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Have you had your appendix out?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Let’s get you to the hospital.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,No.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Funny how things work out, isn’t it?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Good night.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,What about your pedometer?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Why are you doing that?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,All right.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I am doing it.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,We’ll never know.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Okay.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I think so.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Palak paneer, that’s Penny."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Uh, 12 bucks."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Sure.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon’s face, appears). Greetings, friends."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Greetings, whatever the hell you are."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,You’re in your bedroom.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I am looking at you.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,At the hands of your roommate?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,An accident.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,That’s how I’m going to make it look.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Fine, but don’t expect my help."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"No, it’s not."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I’ll be damned.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Uh-huh.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Right.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,No.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,That’s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Whoa!
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I almost died!
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I’m still going to go with you.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,What about it?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Why? What’s the problem?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"No, I think a doorknob has you stymied."
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Why are you introducing yourself?
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,I think it is.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,"Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…"
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Leonard,Of course you must.
4,2,The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,Sheldon,"I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"All right, I’m ready for my next question."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Uganda.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Defend.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,You’re right. My apologies.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,What the hell are you guys playing?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,It’s a game we invented. It’s called Counterfactuals.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,It’s fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"You’re in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Leonard, be serious. We’re playing a game here."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,What?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. You should’ve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,You bumped the table and you know it.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I’m going to my room.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,What?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Sure.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Sorry we’re late.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Okay.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I believe she’s experiencing her menses.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Ah, ah."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"I should’ve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,It’s how they lure you in. I believe it’s called bait and switch.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,They can’t function without me. I’m the social glue that holds this little group together. You’re welcome.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"She’s not my girlfriend. She’s a girl and she’s my friend, but there’s no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Got it.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It’s an action we both regret to this day."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I’ve always been more of an empire man."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Yeah, not my point."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"I know what your point is. You’re intimidated by Amy’s intellect. To that I say, buck up."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,So?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,So we already have you for all that.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Suffered in silence?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Yes. And I’d thank you to do the same.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Really? Silence?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I did.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I didn’t agree with him.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"I tried, but (Penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone) he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Oh, no."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,John and Yoko.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Greetings.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Hey.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I’m doing.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,You take that back.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"That’s the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,There being no objections…
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Amen to that.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Hello.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Regarding what?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I don’t follow.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Penny, I assure you, I’m fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I’m continuing on with my life as before."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to buy a pussycat."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Uh, went splitsville."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Turned to boom-boom.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,He got a cat to keep him company.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, gentlemen."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"My apologies. Raj, Howard, I’d like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Now, if you’ll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Yeah.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Hey. (Turns to see Sheldon now has five cats) Oh, no."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Zazzles?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he’s so zazzy."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, we need to talk."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,About what?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Clowder.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,What?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, yeah, fine."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,It’s the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,It wasn’t a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"You didn’t break up, she dumped you."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I was there. She dumped you.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"You don’t have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I’m already a fan. All right, fellas, who’s in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that’s not fancy at all."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,He’s in his bedroom.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"No, she’s real."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon’s bedroom door)
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Come in. (They enter. The room is full of cats.)
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,Surprise.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"I’d like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf…"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s preposterous. I’m not pining over anyone."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don’t argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you’ll find to be quite zazzy."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Coming!
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Aw.(Enters to find Amy) What is she doing here?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"All right, but you’re not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Yes, ma’am."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"That’s a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I’ve ever met."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can’t see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they’re there."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,A physics point.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,I’ll go as high as 40.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,Would you like to see my cats?
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,I saw what you did there.
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Leonard,"No, no, no, I can do it."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
4,3,The Zazzy Substitution,Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Here’s your cat. And here’s your $20."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you’d be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"You’re wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny? Penny?"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Does it have melon on it?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"No, I can’t eat melon."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,When was the last time you saw her?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Hey.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, I guessed that."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don’t need desks.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Correct.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,You’re two for two.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I’ve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it’s convenient, there’s absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,That’s ridiculous.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Because…
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,It’s my office.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Sheldon.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"All right, all right. He can buy his own desk."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Well, you really want to dot the I’s and cross the T’s, don’t you?"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,They do some of their best work at night.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,One question.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Yeah?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Why on earth are you telling me all this?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,This isn’t a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,It’s actually British.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Brobdingnagian.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna… How did you even get it in here?"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"All right, you’ve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"All right, if you’re not going to remove it, I’ll remove it for you."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Help me move my desk.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"All right, I see what’s going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Stand by for my upcoming tat.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,No. Steve Patterson told me.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Yeah.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,He’s Glissinda the troll.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Yeah, and don’t you forget it."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,"Oh, God, what’s that smell? (Knocks on Sheldon’s door. Sheldon answers in a gas mask). Oh-ho-hoo!"
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,What are you doing in there?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,I’m making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out."
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Leonard,Isn’t that flammable?
4,4,The Hot Troll Deviation,Sheldon,"Highly. Oh, dear. (Explosion)"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Thank you.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,So what’s going on with you two?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Got it.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I sense judgment on your part.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"No, no. Maybe a little."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Oh, right. That."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,I’m not jealous.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Probably. What’s your point?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Hmm, recently? Not much."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Um, shut up."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,That sounds lovely.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put Meemaw in a home!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Hey, guys."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,What?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"No, no, no, no!"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,…who’s a friend.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Thank you.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, good for you."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Why don’t you just break up with her?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Why not?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Leonard? Are you sleeping?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,No.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Are you ill?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,No.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no one loves you?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,I don’t know. Maybe.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about your well-being.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Thank you.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,What the hell? How long has she been here?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,That was two hours ago.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Did you know that, Leonard?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,No.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I did.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Right.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Let’s make that our word of the day.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Yes?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I see. Can I get back to you on that?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Yeah, what?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Yeah. So?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,What does that mean?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Uh-huh.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,You can’t say that anymore.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Wait. What?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,That is insane.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Okay, good luck."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Wait! What am I supposed to do?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Screwed.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,There you go.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Amy’s right. He is tedious.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,The volcano thing? No.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"No, it’s just something I threw on."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,What are you working on?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her mother.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Ah, you’re going off the grid."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Exactly.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,What if she just comes over?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Darn! She found me!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,She’s been here before.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,What do you want to do?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Tell her I’m not here.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Okay, where are you?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Way to go on the details.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Hi.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Uh…
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Whoa!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Yep, it is."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,Whoa!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Rats!
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"My apologies. Good night, Amy."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,"Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…"
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,You’re asking me out?
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Leonard,I look forward to it.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular intercourse with your daughter.
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your daughter’s vagina."
4,5,The Desperation Emanation,Sheldon,"Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Problem?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don’t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Why would I change?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it’s actually extremely plausible."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Why would I touch her, she’s covered with airplane germs."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Cobbler. I’m still laughing.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (Looks around.) Okay.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"The fun starts with brunch at Carney’s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we’re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that’s right, the Hollywood Carney’s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well then apparently, you hate fun."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,He rejected train day.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Abundantly.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,That’s what I said.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Do you like trains?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It’s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I’ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,That’s pretty cool.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Oh yes. It runs on the world’s most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,You’ve really got to get out more.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Go north. You can’t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don’t have the sword. Good golly, it’s as if it’s actually happening to me."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, well, (kissing her) Sheldon’s still up."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"If the past is any indication, no."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I’m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Drop axe.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Give me a minute. Sheldon,"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I know.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Well then, bed mister."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Five more minutes.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"You don’t want that, do you?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,No. But it’s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,That’s unacceptable. We’re supposed to be given written notice.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there’s no water for an enzyme soak."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I’ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let’s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I’m lost. Well, I’ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Yes.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"You’re right, you’re lost, good luck."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,It doesn’t?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,What?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Air freshener.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Very well, I’m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Uh, cream."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Without.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Fine. With.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Use your best judgement.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Sounds great.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Excellent choice.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Priya?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Making pretty good time, huh?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,No.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Like what?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,What are you talking about?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"April 12th, 2005, Bob’s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob’s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,And Raj.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Alright, and Raj."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,And me.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,You?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,You’re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"You mean, you want me to keep a secret."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Yes.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,You know I can’t keep a secret.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Because, well, Batman has the secret."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Like what?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I’ve now just told to Batman. See, I can’t keep a secret."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Ta-da!
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,What.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Ta-da. It’s short for da-da-da-da!
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Kind of busy here, Sheldon."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"I know, that’s why I shortened it."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,What do you want.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,What alibi?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"You’ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn’t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, God."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"You met her at Pasadena’s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin’s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"It’s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn’t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie’s flaming auburn hair."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Where did you get that?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, no-one’s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thankyou. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Hey.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya’s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,I didn’t see it.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Uh, I was out."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve heard of that place, isn’t that Pasadena’s favourite Irish watering hole."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Yes.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Yeah.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Very hard.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Really?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Raj’s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,You put moths in my food?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,For science.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Alright. But I’m watching you.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, sure."
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,"These are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,Guess.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Papaya?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,No.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,Guava?
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,You’re so close.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Leonard,I give up.
4,6,The Irish Pub Formulation,Sheldon,"Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,What does that have to do with me and women?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Excuse me. If we’re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Congratulations Howard.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Why not?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Really?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Want to get that?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Not particularly.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Could you get that?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I suppose I could if I were asked.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Would you please get that?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Yes.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"You say you’re Special Agent Page, FBI."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn’t prove I know Batman.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven’t I heard back yet?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,That’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"A little, but go on."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I’m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn’t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"You heard me say blu-ray, right?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that’s not irresponsible, I don’t know what is."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Did I say Mars Rover?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I don’t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,What happened?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,And I may have hit on her a little bit.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,I feel awful.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,What are you doing up?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Sleep eludes me, Leonard."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Mockery? That’s all you have to offer?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Who knows? I haven’t watched any scary movies recently. I’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it’s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,What?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,But why should that keep me up?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Because you feel guilty?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Interesting. So you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,"Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Excuse me?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"That seems fairly conclusive. (In his bed) No, Gorn, no. That’s where I sit."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Yes.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,No.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I don’t recall you saying no backsies.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. I’d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard’s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O’s for outstanding, which he is such. W’s for witty, he’s quick with a joke. A’s for artistic, his ability…"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, it’s a different Leonard. He’s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Raj. Have you seen Howard?
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I’m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He’s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we’d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I’m here now to say I’m sorry."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"You’re tricking me. It really is, isn’t it?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Oh, shut up."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Hello.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Alcohol.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,More or less.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,That’s not how it looks in the picture.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can’t taste the cherries.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Captain Kirk won.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I’ll reprogram Howard.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Hello, all."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,Hey.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?"
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,It’s for Howard.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this."
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Sheldon,I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
4,7,The Apology Insufficiency,Leonard,94 seconds.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,See? Howard’s on my side.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,But how were our seats?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Excellent.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Shrewd.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Thank you, Amy."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Guys, that’s really starting to get old."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Who’s there?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Hysterical!
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished. I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Knock-knock.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Who‘s there?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Hugh.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Hugh who?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,I informed you thusly.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn’t ordered dessert.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,What’s a stadium pal?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,What did he say?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,We might not get seats?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Of what? Poorly executed beards?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Calm down, Sheldon."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me. (On phone) Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,No!
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don’t.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told you so.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Short Round?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,You whistled?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,What is that?
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can’t see it, no one else can see it."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,"Sheldon, this is crazy."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s Lee, but I prefer Trouble."
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Leonard,Yeah.
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,"Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
4,8,The 21 Second Excitation,Sheldon,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"As usual, you’re all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Now you just being silly. Wolverine’s never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. (Answering phone) Hello. Yes, the elevator’s out of order you’ll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, um, is Penny here?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Yeah.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Okay, I think a bit of context here might help."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, good. Context."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,That was odd.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"I don’t care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,You’ll never guess what just happened.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you’re back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,No.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,Aw.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Penny kissed me.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Well, who would ever guess that?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,A big kiss. On the mouth.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,You think?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Why do I bother talking to you people?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"If it’ll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,I’m starting to think we’re never going to see that pizza.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,What? Why?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Really? How, how’d we manage that?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, no, I don’t think so."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,See? He doesn’t mind.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Come here, you."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Thanks for the steak, Wyatt."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,A lot of people are doing that.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Maybe I could go in a little late.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Don’t I know it.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,I love you.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Coming. Hey, lovebug."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Well, then, what do you want?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, excellent. I’d like to say I’m very happy that you’re back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I’d like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny’s annoying personal habits."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I’ll have no truck with plots.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Uh, we don’t discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Fines?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Yes. If Penny’s going to be spending nights here again, you’ll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,No hurry.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,What?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,I’ll give it a shot.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Excuse me?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,I’ll friend you on Facebook.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,"Oh, how’d it go last night?"
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,"I’m going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret."
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,Hey.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Sheldon,Hello.
4,9,The Boyfriend Complexity,Leonard,You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Clarify something for me. Isn’t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,"It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Great.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"What is the best number? By the way, there’s only one correct answer."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Wrong. The best number is 73. You’re probably wondering why.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,No.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?"
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,No. What happened?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,"12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Aren’t you slicing that man’s brain a little too thin?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, you’re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,I’d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,All right. What were the symptoms?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Localized to what region?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Who?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Then why did you ask?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Who.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, let’s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?"
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Zack.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Because you keep saying who.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"And the answer was Zack, correct?"
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Hang on. I don’t know that we’ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Don’t. It’s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Cheap science fiction?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I hadn’t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I’ve considered it."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,I reject it.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Hello.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I’ll need time to make things right."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,The alternative would be to think backwards. And that’s just remembering.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Amy’s changed. I might have to let her go.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,What insult?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Forget science. She’s horny.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s simple biology. There’s nothing I can do about it.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you suggesting?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s illegal to spay a human being.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I’ll let you know what happens."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I’m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I’m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl’s name. No, it doesn’t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I’m calling. I’d like to know if you’d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl’s name. Good grief. It’s like trying to talk to a dolphin."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Every idea is better than this idea.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell’s Angel.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Are you sure this is what you want to do?
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system."
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,Please don’t drag this out. This is never going to come off.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Leonard,Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,I’m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
4,10,The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you doing?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Infinite Sheldon?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"No, although it’s a question I’ve been pondering since preschool."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Hey.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Hey.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Oh, thanks."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,That’s an atom.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"So, you and Zack again, huh?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,They might be smarter than some people.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s easy enough. We’d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,A dolphin might.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,That’s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,That happened to you?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Why me?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,What would I even say?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Zack, I’m sorry you’re stupid. Have a Milk Dud."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,You’re embarrassing yourself.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Penny.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,That’s very hurtful.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,See?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Milk Dud?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Literally? Literally a million years?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Don’t.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Of course. We’re coming as the Justice League of America.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"That’s sad. Let’s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Zack?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,You can’t replace me with Zack.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Why not? Penny did it.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,You can be Aquaman.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler doesn’t believe in wearing costumes. She isn’t the free spirit I am.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,What are you doing?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,We’re going to be late. I’m pacing nervously.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,You’re jogging.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,This is how the Flash paces.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I’m not Sheldon. I’m the Flash. And now I’m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I’m back.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he’s running late."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I’m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Don’t. He’s making our case.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"(Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"I’m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I understand why you’re upset.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Yes. You’re afraid that costume makes you look fat.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Don’t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"But they’re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,She didn’t tell you?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Who else would it be?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I may have failed.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"Obviously, we’re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I’m Kermit. You’re Scooter.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,What makes you think I can convince her?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Hey.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Then what are you?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,Green Lantern.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,What about me?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Oh.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,What’s the bad news?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Thank you! Thank you so much!
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"No, wait! I have a speech."
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,Stop counting!
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,"This is my moment, dag nab it!"
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,I’m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I’m waiting.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,You’re being a bully.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,What should we do?
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Sheldon,We’re the Justice League of America. There’s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
4,11,The Justice League Recombination,Leonard,"Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"I won’t say that all senior citizens who can’t master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Howard doesn’t. He’s only an engineer.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, that’s actually a valid idea. Very good."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I’d have to give a slight edge to the cat. I’ll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Yeah.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Oh!
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, shush."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you’re just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,She’s not going to steal our idea.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,We’re gonna write an application…
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Of Texas.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Satisfied?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,That is ridiculous.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Well let’s see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"All right, I’ve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we’re a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Duly noted, Steve from Wichita."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother’s birthday is coming up. I’m going to need you to pick up a present."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Okay, we need to stop for a minute."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We’ll need snacks."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You’re clearly listed as founder."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"All right. All right, I’m not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, we’re doomed."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Good one, boss."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee’s esprit de corps.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m, I’m sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Are you done?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"If you say so, boss."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Does it? A happy accident.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,We’re not doing names now. Howard?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"All right, fine. If we’re not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,No.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,That’s just Sheldon backwards.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Another happy accident.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,We’re not wasting time with names right now.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,No.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,No.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Oh Sheldon, stop it."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together…"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"That’s enough, Sheldon."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"All right, let’s get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Okay, that’s it, you’re fired."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Really? Why?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Because you’re impossible to work with.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I see. And is that open for discussion?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What are you doing?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you’ll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,But I fired you.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, I know. I’m now an independent contractor."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,But I made it better.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Well, that speaks volumes, doesn’t it? All right, I suppose I’ll go put on my bus pants."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What the hell are bus pants?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"They are pants one wears over one’s regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you’ve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. You earned it.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"I’m sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn’t press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I’ll be back."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Hold on. That’s it!
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn’t want to impede your progress."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What are you doing?!
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Playing the theremin.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Playing it. I’ve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it’s been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Sheldon! We’re working here!
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"That’s all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. (Leonard pulls out plug) Well, that was a little uncalled for."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"No, that was completely called for. We need quiet."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"So, your project is more important than mine?"
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Don’t beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don’t want me here, just say the word, and I’ll leave."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Could have beaten around the bush a little.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I’m practicing my theremin.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,He wouldn’t drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Yes. And they’re still sticky.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Probably going to have to throw them away.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,With you?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,That’s your app idea?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"I didn’t say that. But no, I don’t."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"I know, it’s baffling. (Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Do you make it with milk or water?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Real cocoa?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Do you have those little marshmallows?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose it’s appropriate."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,What’s he doing in your apartment?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,We’re not playing. This is real work.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Really? Leonard wants me back?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Well, we sure saw that coming."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,You know what I’m going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,How?
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn’t raise her no liars."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,No.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,I was being sarcastic.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Boy, I’m getting good at this."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,"Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Well, I must say, I am impressed."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Leonard,Thanks.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let’s start fresh. Howard, we’re going to need some tea."
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,Bored.
4,12,The Bus Pants Utilization,Sheldon,"Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm…"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o’clock and order the same exact thing, and it’s now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Probably serving food that was ordered today.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,I think her weekend just opened up.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"In order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers’ Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.”
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,You lied to me?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Good morning. If I could have everyone’s attention, please? I know we’re all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I’m sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it’s just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we’re off."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Raj? What are you doing? I don’t think so. You’ve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn’t until the Denny’s located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we’re only as strong as our weakest bladder."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,They’re bigger than mine.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,It’s eleven fifteen. I’m requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone’s toilet routine.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,I can vouch for that.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Not you, him."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Although yours was an eye-opener.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Are you an element in the actinoid series?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,No. Amy?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,No.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Amy, it’s Penny’s turn. Penny?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,That’s not apropos. We’ve already established I’m found in the periodic table.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,I knew she wasn’t lead car material.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Leonard.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,What?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Uh, sure."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"So, how do you wanna do this?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Okay, when you say make the best of it."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Good night.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Please tell me you’re not having coitus.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Can you guarantee that it won’t happen at any time during the night?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,No.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? (Knock, knock, knock) Raj? I need to sleep here tonight."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny’s bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,No.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Sure, no problem."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,True dat.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Okay, good night."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Penny’s here. (Raj whispers to him) No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we’ll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science’s responsibility to society?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Excuse me. We’re not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we see if we can bring this back to topic."
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,I guess not.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"All right, why don’t we open it up to Q&A from the audience?"
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,No!
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,Must be out of range.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,Sure.
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Leonard,No. Why do you ask?
4,13,The Love Car Displacement,Sheldon,"All right, if no one’s going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Read this woman’s tweet.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Yeah.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"In a word, triumphant."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Really? Triumphant?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Tell me what?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,No.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,For instance?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"You’re an (finger quotes) actress, correct?"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,All right. You’re an actress. I need you to teach me.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"So, when could we start?"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I suppose that’s one way to look at it.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Are you going to help me or not?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I’ll pay you 40 dollars.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Nothing. I was acting.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,How shall we begin?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,All right.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,You’re the teacher.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Gotcha.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,All right.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Action.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"I’d like a frozen yogurt, please."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Yeah.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,You do?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, and we’re going to use props?"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,You have any frozen yogurt?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,"Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,Have you seen him?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Leonard,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Yes. I didn’t care for it.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Why don’t we leave that for future generations to decide?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"It’s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon’s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. You’ll be Spock?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Very well. I’ll set the scene.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Hoo!
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I’ll never understand that boy. But then again, I’m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain’t foolin’ no one, and get your shotgun!"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just don’t buy it.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.”"
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,Why?
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes, but he’s going to a better place where he won’t get beat up. So much."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,I’m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Oh, Shelly? A man’s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Mommy, why are you crying? ‘Cause I’m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well I’m sorry. It’s not my fault. I’m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don’t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy’s late for Indian bingo."
4,14,The Thespian Catalyst,Sheldon,"Mommy, I love you. Don’t let Spock take me to the future!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Perhaps he’s emulating Shakespeare’s Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he’d have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I’ve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"It’s not a touch phobia, it’s a germ phobia. If you’d like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn’t mean you should jump into his windowless van. What’s the occasion?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"I don’t care, it’s demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don’t want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign’s uniform."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Ugh!
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Are you sure this is right?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Oh. We should get going.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Sheldon is not going.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Really? What do we tell Siebert?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Don’t tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Thanks.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,More than this?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Coffee maker?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I’m not above minimizing your window."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,That’s it. Prepare to be minimized.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Are you trying to scare me? ‘Cause you’re succeeding.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,No!
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Oh, the humanities!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Why?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Okay, I see what’s happening."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,What?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"My stature intimidates her, so she’s using you to get to me. Crafty old gal."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"No, that can’t be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we’re best friends. And I got your back, Jack."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,That was a great meal.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,No kidding.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Oh, good, good."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Terrific. Great. What level is that? (She grabs him and kisses him) Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"You know, it’s a shame, all that work she’s doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It’ll take two weeks."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Um, I’m not sure."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Oh, wow!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Why?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,She hit on me.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,I think so.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,What?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Penny, you’re an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"I repeat, not gonna happen."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Hold on, I have something for you."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,What’s this?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Just a few things you may need tonight. There’s, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,I am not going to have sex with her.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Oh, come on! Why not?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Good night, Sheldon."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,No. But thank you for asking.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Hey. Hi.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"I’m very hungry. For food, right?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"No, that’s okay."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Really?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Oh. Then what was last night about?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Oh.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Thank you.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"No, it’s true."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,I hadn’t really given it much thought.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Do you mean?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,What?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,What’s going on?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Are you just getting home?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,Yeah.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"That’s a good sign, right?"
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,I’m so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"No, I didn’t do it for the money."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,She stiffed you?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,What?
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,"Uh, I’m gonna go lie down."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,"That’s a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn’t learn anything from his relationship with you."
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Sheldon,Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
4,15,The Benefactor Factor,Leonard,I didn’t do it for the money!
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Hey, what’s up?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Uh, sure. Why?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,What’s going on?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,No.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"You heard the man, Leonard. And while you’re at it, I’m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn’t you seek refuge under his roof?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Wait, wait. What?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I’m down in the dumps here."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Priya’s in town?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Hold on. When did Priya get here?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Don’t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"No, no. I’ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever’s troubling you."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,That’s what tertiary friends are for.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,It’s Leonard.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,I just want to talk to her.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,What are you doing here?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Why didn’t you call?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you’re welcome to.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,Hello.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,The word is forbade.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Priya, if you’re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Really?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"I love the way you say, I’d love that."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,My sister’s 38 and married.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"That’s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation’s airports."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"No, no. It’s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,Did you get the part?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,Whose tongue?
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Leonard,"What, with my tongue in your tail?"
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,It’s actually Thai. You’re slipping.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"At home, forbidding it."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,I’m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,"Actually, it’s the three of us."
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,Right. I’ll make tea.
4,16,The Cohabitation Formulation,Sheldon,I’m sorry. It’s not optional.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m out of here."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Just come with me to Raj’s.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t want to go to a party."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Because we don’t throw parties.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,I guess you’re right. See you later.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s serving both."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, dear!"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,What?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Ugh!
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Right.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Is it about me or the dead pixels?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Oh, sounds great."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Hi.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Just sit here.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all forced to hang out at his apartment."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Cluck-cluck-cluck.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,What you doing?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,I’m setting out snacks.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,You’re having people over?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar Burton."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Possibly. I Tweeted him.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Of course. Good night.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Leonard.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Yeah?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"We had a good run, you and I."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Okay.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,But change is a part of life.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,It certainly is.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,I am leaving.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Of course. Barry?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, you must be present to win."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Surprisingly, yes."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,The water level rose.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m fun."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,I’m unhappy.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Hear, hear."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,He kind of does.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,"Aw, hell, I miss him."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,No.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Thank you.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Leonard,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Thank you.
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,Are there beans in it?
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little short-tempered."
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
4,17,The Toast Derivation,Sheldon,She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Morning.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Fine. Give me a second.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Sorry! Oop!
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Thank you.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Just two. Everyday and dress.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, okay. So, what’s up?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Oh. Okay.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"I’m sorry. I’m, never mind."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Um…
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Yeah.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,No?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Yeah.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Yeah, bitches are the worst."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,No.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Sure, that has birds in it."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, yes. Indeed, I did."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,What?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"As you wish. (Cards slide under door) Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. (Leonard does not) Did you pick one?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Yep.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,(Sliding card under door) Is this your card?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,(Not looking) Nope.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Drat. Is this your card?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,No.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,I’ll be right back.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Whatcha doin’?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,What’s up with the infrared cameras?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Relax, we’re not under attack right now."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Or as you probably call it back home, food."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Small world.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Bye.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,It is pretty spicy.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,All right. Pick a card.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Bippity-boppity-boo.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"I said, ta-da. Show’s over."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,That does it. I’m getting uranium.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,Move out.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Yes. There, I said it."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,And she likes you.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Not really, no."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Leonard,"Penny, wait. (Bumps into door) Damned contacts."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Hello.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,Figure out the magic trick yet?
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,No.
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,"Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business."
4,18,The Prestidigitation Approximation,Sheldon,I hate you.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,What’s going on?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"They stole everything, Leonard, everything."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did they get?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"What didn’t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,They took my battle ostrich.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Oh, no, not Glenn?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Wait a minute! You’re not going to do anything?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Doctor Cooper.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Not the kind with access to drugs.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"That’s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,It’s all gone. All gone.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"I’m really sorry, Sheldon."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man’s battle ostrich?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,I don’t know.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"I’m on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,See if Raj is done with Pilates.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It’s almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Oh! There isn’t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Can we trust him?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"No. Glenn’s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven’t given up hope."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing… all right, technically it’s a game."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,I thought I just did.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,We got him. We’re almost done.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn’t start talking, we’ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"I don’t care! I’m losin’ it, man!"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,That’s not where it was going.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,And people think I don’t get sarcasm.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,That’s a relief.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,What?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Really?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"I’ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,The name and the address drip with evil.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Excellent! It’s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"I don’t know if you’ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,No one’s getting tortured.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Fine, we’ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who’s with me?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Sure.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Fine. Leonard?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Aw, screw it. I’m in."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I’m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,That’s incredible.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Cover for me.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,That’s uncanny.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Totally.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let’s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,I always prefer the train.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Coming.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,No weapon strikes more fear into a man’s heart than a Klingon bat’leth.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,No.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Well, now I just feel silly holding it."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Come on.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Can I at least kick down the door?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Your doom!
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Good point. Basket of puppies.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Are you Todd Zarnecki?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Careful. That’s a collectible.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Well, he’s even more cunning than we thought."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"You know, the joke’s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat’leth is worthless."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Oh-oh.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Of course.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,No.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,It’d be swell if they had a train.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Uh, I kind of told her I was working."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,"Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,No. We failed in our noble quest.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,Todd Zarnecki was mean.
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Leonard,What are you doing?
4,19,The Zarnecki Incursion,Sheldon,"We did it! I said, we."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Hysterical.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you’re in a comedy club.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Ba-dum-bump.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Gossip? I’m disappointed in you."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Forgive my language, but poppycock."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what’s the 4-1-1?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I believe our nation’s tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,You’ve dedicated your life’s work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Nice shot.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It’s odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Perfect.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you’re doing?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Shooting at a target?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,With what?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,An arrow.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Really? I didn’t see you draw one from your quiver.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"I’m not going to do that, Sheldon."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. (Leonard mimes drawing an arrow and stabbing Sheldon with it.) That was uncalled for, but I’ll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Really? How could you tell?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,You don’t say?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"So, what’s the gossip?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Fine, don’t tell me."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Mm, it’s hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents’ marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"– Priya, can I come in?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Oh, God."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Really? Who?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,What? You’re kidding!
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Wow, that’s hard to believe."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Hey!
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,No.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,I can’t say.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,I’ve been thinking about Dr. Greene’s efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Oh, yeah? What about it?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"That’s all. I’ve just been thinking about it. Now, I’m thinking about fractal equations. Now I’m thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I’m thinking about trains."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Lucky bastard.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Now I’m thinking about Jell-O.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Marry you?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Oh, I’d wait."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Man, he’s going to be blindsided."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Why are you smiling?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Yeah, Raj, why?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m back to trains. Woo-woo."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,No.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Have you learned anything?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"If you don’t mind, I’d like to stop listening to you and start talking."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I’m familiar with everything, but go on."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I’m no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper’s a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,It’s one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don’t find repellent.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You’re a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Hey.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Hey.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Hope you’re hungry.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It’s a lesson in context."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Yes, I believe so."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Good, good. Everything okay between you two?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Yes. Why do you ask?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,No. That’s not what he meant.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Yeah, you do. You dog, you."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Did you get that?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,This is moving faster than we thought.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Pass the soy sauce.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Pun intended?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,I’m sorry. What pun?
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,"I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,"Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times."
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,Congratulations!
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Sheldon,Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,That’s great.
4,20,The Herb Garden Germination,Leonard,You’re pregnant?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in the shower?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot now."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,What?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,What kind of emergency?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,You might not want to do that.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I assure you I do.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Sheldon, I’m not alone in here."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"We were in here first, you can’t be in here."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Move. Move. Move!
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Yeah, fine."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Um, it’s fairly technical."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Do so, do so."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,But…
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Schooled!
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Superceded!
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,This isn’t over.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we switched to Graziano’s."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,No.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Not as much as you.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,I got you the lamb kabob.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Shotgun.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I don’t know how to process that.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"No, you most certainly are not."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi driver says something into radio in Korean. The word “waltz” is included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings Blue Danube. Dispatcher says “oh, waltz!” They speak Korean some more. )"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What happened to you?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What’s 16 times 14?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,And there’s your answer.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. Is someone smoking?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,You own a smoking monkey?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,What’s he doing here?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Thank you. May I share something with you that’s troubling me?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"No, of course not."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,No.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Are you suggesting I play dirty?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Fascinating.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to sign it."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Why would I want to do that?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,What’s the big deal?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,20 seconds.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Are you ashamed of me?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Then why can’t we tell your parents?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"No, he’s bluffing."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I never bluff. Ten.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,It’s blackmail!
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Nine.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Eight.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,This is ridiculous. (Pulls out plug)
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Three.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,Really?
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,Two.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Leonard,"Okay, I’ll sign it!"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Good morning, Amy."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left."
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
4,21,The Agreement Dissection,Sheldon,"You’re preaching to the choir, sister."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Okay, see you later."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,That is good news. Bye.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"That, that’s brilliant."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?"
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,All right.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Elegant.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,That’s because it’s simple.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,And…
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,And what?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time machines."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Got it. Bye.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,You know I’m right.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,You okay?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Very pretty.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Hadn’t really thought about it.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Uh, sure. Very… prominent."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Sorry.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Yeah. How did you know?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Really? In front of your sister?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,You’re kidding. 3-D?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,No.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?"
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Sorry, I have company."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I don’t want to hug you.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Blue, as in depressed."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I don’t know what colour lonely is.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I’m working on my three-person chess game.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,Yellow. Go ahead.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,Fascinating. What’s in it?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I like cows.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,It was its own point. Go on.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to emulate.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here to observe."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,All right.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I’d like to buy a scone.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,They were out of scones.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Thanks, yeah."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s Gorilla two.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Leonard,"Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon."
4,22,The Wildebeest Implementation,Sheldon,I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Uh, that’s my water."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,What?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,My water. You’re drinking it.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Yes. It’s my water.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Well, that’s it then. I’m dead."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Here we go.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"I’m sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Yes, I’d like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,He drank from Leonard’s glass. Words they’ll be carving into my tombstone.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,That’s actually my napkin.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, this is a nightmare!"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,You all right?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Fire demon.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Water nymph.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Last one.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,What’s going on?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord!"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,That’s not your water.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Where’s the mouthwash?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Hello.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Jibber-jabber? I don’t jibber-jabber.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, let’s go!"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don’t think so."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,I can’t.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It’s the same way I’m not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,I would think he would know that.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Fine, I’ll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother’s mantel."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"So, how is she?"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,A heart-attack-like event is an event that’s like a heart attack.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What’s more likely going to kill Howard’s mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Disagree.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Go sit over there.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"I’ll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,What are you talking about?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"No, I do not. You are a mean little man."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"No, I haven’t. It’s all good."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,There was one time I put body glitter on.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"No, she wouldn’t."
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,You really are a mean little man.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,"Hey, what took you guys so long?"
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,That’s nice. What about?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,That’s funny.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Mountain Elf.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Leonard,Hell Hounds.
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,Must you?
4,23,The Engagement Reaction,Sheldon,"Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Sure
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Kill me.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"So, what’s your news, Bernadette?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Oh, congratulations."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,All right.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Rotating.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,You mean the myofascial point?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,There’s someone at my door.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Why?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"No, I can’t authorize that."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,I never kid about safety.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,What are you doing here?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,In my bed?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, you heard?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Just not against their will.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Until you have kids.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You’re okay to stay for a while."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Please sign."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,No backsies.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,What is this?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been skating by all these years.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice touch, by the way."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s looking good.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,When does a monkey have a trunk?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Mmm. Mmm.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Sorry.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,When is the time?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Fine.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,You’re moving back to India?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,When were you going to tell me about this?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,"Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up."
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,So. Hot in India?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,What are you doing here?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,What?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"I said, what are you doing here?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,I live here.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,I have paperwork that says differently.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Priya’s going back to India.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you’re not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing here?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Why?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,"Leonard, do you understand this?"
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,Yes.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,Talk to him.
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Leonard,What’s going on?
4,24,The Roommate Transmogrification,Sheldon,What does it look like?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,It’s not what it looks like. It’s not what it looks like.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,What are you grinding about?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Penny’s brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it’s not what it looks like."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Just let it go, Sheldon."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"If I could, I would, but I can’t, so I shan’t. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that’s what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let’s put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj’s anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That’s a true blue friend."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"They slept together, Sherlock."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"No, you weren’t listening. She said, it’s not what it looks like."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,She lied.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,Oh. Well don’t I look silly sitting here wearing this?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,Hey.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"No, I’m fine with it."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"That sounds like sarcasm, but I’m going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don’t see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can’t be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,What the hell is wrong with you?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, if I may interject, I’ve decided my rank will be captain. If it’s good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it’s good enough for me."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"For the record, I do have genitals. They’re functional and aesthetically pleasing."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Subtlety isn’t her strong suit, is it?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can’t see you."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"I’m not in the mood, Sheldon."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you’re upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,I don’t want to talk to Amy.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"No, it’s not Amy."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,You called my mother?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,What’s going on? What do you want?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,That’s so nice.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Well, uh, okay, um, I don’t want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn’t work, but I can’t deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj’s sister Priya, who I’ve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I’m just completely confused and alone."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,Got any advice?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Excuse me. You’re a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you’ve got is buck up?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Thanks, Mother. I feel much better."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Give it a second to load. Whenever you’re ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they’re out of sunblock, which means they’ll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That’s our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won’t know what hit them. All right, let’s move out."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"You know what, guys, I’m not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,You can’t quit. That’s a court-martial offence. That’s punishable by… You can’t quit.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Sorry, Sheldon, it’s just not a good time for playing games."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Yes, no and no."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I haven’t earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that’s what we’re going to be.
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,What are you doing?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn’t a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,Let’s get ’em!
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"If there’s ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!"
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,"Excuse me. It’s Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It’s kind of a big deal."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, sure."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,You’re leaving?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,"Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you’re not doing this ’cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you’re a single woman."
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Sheldon,What about Nebraska?
5,1,The Skank Reflex Analysis,Leonard,I’m proud of you.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,What are you doing?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,That doesn’t sound like mocking.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t know. Why?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be calling any minute, so…"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, I’ve always admired that about you."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception here.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, good."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,A hobby?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"You know, some people might say that it’s great that we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Don’t you like Amy?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Of course I like Amy.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Well, there’s the difference. (Skype tone rings)"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Excuse me, that’s Priya."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Hey, honey."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, I miss you, too."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,A good wife would go to the store.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Chair.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,What?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,I’ve been sitting in garbage!
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Yep.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Not easy, but we’re making it work."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,What?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,I can’t do that.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"I did it last night, I’m not doing it again."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs from Penny’s chair.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Name one time I’ve ever done that.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you’d started growing again.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s a health hazard.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Really?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That’s reassuring.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,All right. It is a comfortable chair.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny’s apartment."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,It’s like living with a Chihuahua.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,You have to get rid of the chair.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"So, here we are. Back in bed together."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Not good?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re, you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google how to do this. I’ll call you right back.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Okay, like usual. Good."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yes, ma’am."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, damn it!"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just buffering, just give it a second."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"So, how are your mom and dad?"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Yeah. Sure, sure."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"Is not. Is not, is not."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,No.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"You’re good friends with Penny, right?"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"All right, name your price."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,You mean like Salt Lake City?
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,Thank you.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Sheldon,"No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I’m sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!"
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"I don’t know about this, Howard."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,I don’t think so.
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
5,2,The Infestation Hypothesis,Leonard,"That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more, ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Who wants the last dumpling?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Aren’t you going with Sheldon?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Amy?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,You okay?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,I thought you were reading.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"I, I’m fine."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"What, who told you that?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, you stay as long as you’d like."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that’s exactly what he thinks."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care what you people do."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Not really. Is that my yearbook?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Aw.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Rough night, Casey Jones?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,What’s in the bag?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a spine,I’ll tell you that."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Ah, sure. That’d be nice."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists there my age.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Ready.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Amy, this is for you."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O trainiac.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,I’m not moody. I’m fun.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it’s okay to have fun once in a while.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, okay. Again, thank you."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Okay. Well, good night."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,"Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth."
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Sounds like you had a great night.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,I did. How was yours?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,What exactly do you mean by that?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,"Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin’s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?"
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,To send a message. She is not for you.
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Leonard,What?
5,3,The Pulled Groin Extrapolation,Sheldon,Not for you!
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?"
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,You see a dragon.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?"
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Now that Howard’s getting married, maybe he’ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please focus. You’re facing a fire-breathing dragon."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Because you don’t have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game’s in serious trouble."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Are we ready to order?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,One moment. I’m conducting an experiment.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yes. From here on in, I’ve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,Let’s see what I’ll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Do you really want that?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,That’s the great thing. It doesn’t matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,Hamburgers and lemonade.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That’s what I’m talking about!"
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,Don’t thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Because it’s working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I’ve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I’m close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, every night for the last month."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,You think she’s taking advantage of him?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Deaf women can’t be gold diggers?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,Could you tell us?
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Let’s see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Okay, get this. It doesn’t matter if he’s showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I’m not sure what’s tripping you up."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Look, I know they have money. I don’t think it’s that much."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"No, you’re wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren’t just rich, they’re Richie Rich rich."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Listen, guys, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj’s sister, who I love so much. So vastly much."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Can’t figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to… (rolls dice) stay right here."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that’s not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Leonard,"Yeah, real big of you."
5,4,The Wiggly Finger Catalyst,Sheldon,"Hurry, hurry, hurry."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,What did you have in mind?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica of England.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look silly? Okay, let’s go for it."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Yeah. It’s okay, I guess."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Okay? It’s magnificent.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Oh, that’s pretty steep."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Hang on. Can you do any better?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Slow down. Two hundred.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Will you shut up?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Nope. Maybe another time.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Take it, take it."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Two hundred.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Killing you? I can’t breathe.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so sorry."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,So?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Hello, Wil Wheaton."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,I’m not surprised.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family discount.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,I was actually thinking about going.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Possibly.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Can you or can’t you?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"It’s not that simple, Leonard."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"It never is, is it?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger’s Friendship."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Got it. Can I have my water?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment…"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Mohammed Lee.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality. We’re all very proud of you."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Thank you.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You sicken me."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"You never stop talking, do you?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Well, I started the list when I was nine."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you’re looking for."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Not yet.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your last chance."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,You want to drive?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,Brent Spiner?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Yes.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,I don’t care.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,"I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Yeah.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,What are you doing here?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet Brent Spiner and go home."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Sheldon,"Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house."
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Can we get autographed dolls?
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Ten.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Twelve.
5,5,The Russian Rocket Reaction,Leonard,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want to cook."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re going to make me?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Told you.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,The prospect of fried chicken.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that, too."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front. She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone white."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Please pester her. Please, for me."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Get them before they get us.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Raj, what are you doing?"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Offer them a hot beverage.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Coffee.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,You want some Oreos?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Double Stuf?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"No, regular."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"It is nice, isn’t it?"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,These are delicious.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn’t do anything wrong.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I’m not going, and you can’t make me."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your mind."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,Sorry. Syrup.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful son, believe it, because it’s true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard’s hand)"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,I hadn’t…
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You’d love that, wouldn’t you?"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Oh, I’m not sure we should."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,"Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be great."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Leonard,Here.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we’re the same. (Sneezes)"
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth living."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Okay.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom.You’re the best."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Yours.
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"No, we don’t. The one we have works great."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,Get out!
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"Well, I know, but he means well. Sing."
5,6,The Rhinitis Revelation,Sheldon,"What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o’clock."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what’s going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch’s cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichés. Instead of eek, I say yawn."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, there’s nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints).
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Hang on. Looks like everyone’s a winner.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Droll.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you’ve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you’ve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I’m Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. It’s issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Sorry.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yes, but you’d be using your superpowers for evil."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Leonard.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Sorry, palm’s a little sweaty. What’s that word?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"No, I don’t think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Be sure to check the mail.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,How many times are you gonna tell me? What’s with you?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Nothing. It’s not suspicious that I’m fixating. It’s consistent with my personality.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Right.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,More Halloween candy? Didn’t you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Leonard doesn’t have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Will you relax? I’ll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Open the mail!
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard’s face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I’m from New Jersey."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, you know, it’s Comic Con. I’m Lion-O from ThunderCats."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,You’re kidding. You have your own book?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Cool. Oh, look. That’s you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,You’re very talented. This is really good. Did you do… (she kisses him.)
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,You can have my car.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"It is, isn’t it? Oh, bother. Isn’t that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you’re out of staples. Gosh, I wish I’d known that earlier today when I was at Staples."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don’t you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Be a lamb and check.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s a snake. A terrifying snake.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Stop talking like that. You’ve been rendered speechless by fear.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You’re better than this."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Thanks.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No. Lactose. Gas.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No. Sulfites. Migraines.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, we used to go out, right?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"I’m dealing with a situation and it’s kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"So, you’re okay talking about this?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,You’re sure it’s not weird.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Come on.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"I met this girl, and she’s great. We have a lot in common."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No. We just made out a little.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Here’s the thing, I, I’m not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"The problem is, I want to be one of those guys."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, that’s not who I am."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Now, let’s not do anything rash. She’s really hot."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Now we’re getting somewhere.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Go ask Penny; she’ll know what to do.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Hello, Howard. I’ve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,What are you doing?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Science. You wouldn’t understand.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, well, see you. I’m going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn’t.)"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,I thought you were leaving the apartment.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Yeah, me, too. I can’t make up my mind."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No. I’m having a moral crisis.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Well, if it’s of any help, I’ve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, what the hell. I’m supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don’t know if I should, because I’m going out with Priya, but she’s in India."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won’t be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn’t do more than the stuff that you did, and I’m pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,That actually does help.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,It’s worth noting that he died of syphilis.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Screw it, I’m going."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,Do you mind? I’m questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,No.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Great. Tropicana, no pulp."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"It’s me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Really? That’s very unsettling.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Hi.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‘er there, you old so-and-so."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Holy smoke, why didn’t I think of that? You’re a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Well, I thought he made that up. Isn’t hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,We are?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, no! I can’t!"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,Okay.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"Oh, God! One, two, three!"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Sheldon,"What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu… (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself)."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Damn it, I can’t. I can’t, I can’t do this."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"No, no, no. I, I can’t do this. Believe me, I really want to."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,But I kind of have a girlfriend.
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"You’re cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Wait, I don’t, which part?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I’m gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that’s not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That’s kind of my superpower. I’m, like, Captain Good Guy."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,It’s okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Hey, Priya."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, not so good. We have to talk."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it’s done, it’s never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,It is?
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don’t deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Uh, kind of?"
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot."
5,7,The Good Guy Fluctuation,Leonard,"Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I’m, I’m sorry, I have to go. I don’t believe this."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,You’re leaving?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"This time, it’s your fault."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"No, it’s not gonna do it."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,What?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh air."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Did you try calling her on the telephone?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if she’s all right."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,You do?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by a bobcat."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Forget about the bobcat.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Uh, she’s your friend. Step up."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"(Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,Where are you going?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"I’m single, I don’t need this crap."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,You didn’t respond to any of my electronic communications.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,And that made you feel sad?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s craw."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,Always.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,The two of you need to get your women in line!
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle bunny!"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my girlfriend.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Moo-shu is Penny.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,What’s going on?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Really? Amy?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a handful."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Hi, Amy."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Cuddles?
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Amy, what are you doing here?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Maybe we should get you home.
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,"Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Sheldon,"I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go."
5,8,The Isolation Permutation,Leonard,Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Not really.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Star Wars on Blu-ray.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"I know, it’s high-resolution sadness."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Really? Do we do that?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since we broke up."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Sounds like most of my dates.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Shoo, shoo! Be gone!"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,What the hell is going on?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Movies, yes."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,That doesn’t help.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Sheldon, just ignore him."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s going to be a long night."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,The bird’s still there?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I don’t know. Scree-scree.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help, don’t help."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her to think that I think it’s a date.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Do you think it’s a date?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"No, but she might think I think it’s a date even though I don’t."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date even though she doesn’t.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Are we overthinking this?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Not at all.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I pick a movie we see."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I hate those movies.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,All the time.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn’t?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,A minute.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s what’s important."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn’t move.)"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Uh, right."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That’s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I know what you’re doing.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren’t on a date.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Come on, he’s not that cute."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I’m serious. I’ll do it.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,They’re in a group. I’m scared.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That’s a living thing, get cracking."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"No, it’s fine. You can ditch away."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang out with me."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Yep.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over there. You should go talk to them."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,That’s kind of between me and…
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Laura.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Spell asthma."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… (Laura has gone) You’re right, it’s getting late."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t offered you a beverage."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,"How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,Really?
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?"
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,"You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be."
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Leonard,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
5,9,The Ornithophobia Diffusion,Sheldon,Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"It’s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that’s cool."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid’s cowboy hat?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Couple of weirdos. Why?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Sure. I guess.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,I hate all of you and myself. Three.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Hey, can I talk to you about something? It’s a little awkward."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you’re at, you’re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Yeah, that’s not it. Stuart’s kind of interested in Amy."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, of course he is. She’s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,No. He wanted me to find out if you’d have a problem with him asking her out.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"I’m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don’t own Amy. Can’t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you’re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you’ll have to know."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,You know what? Never mind. I’m going to tell him it’s okay to ask her out.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you’d feel about it."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,I am not washed-up.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can’t until you admit the problem."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Where’s Stuart?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Who are you?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Really?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka’a expansion pack.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,You okay?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Am I okay? Leonard, I’m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I’m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We’re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I’m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Yeah.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Yeah.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"All right, fine. Let’s just play."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,We should go easy on him. Amy’s out with Stuart tonight.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who’s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,It’s you.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"I’m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,You’ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Don’t be silly. I’m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,"Sheldon, why don’t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don’t want her going out with other men?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,That’s all of us. Can I use the laptop?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Why?
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Leonard,I have to buy that stupid collector’s tin.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Penny.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Thank you.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you’d like to take in a prizefight."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,I believe I do.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,I’m the guy.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,You tramp.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Pardon me. Excuse me.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Stuart, please. You’re being rude."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,You’re being impossible.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Well, that’s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here’s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you’re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Mutual indemnification always is. Why don’t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette."
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,I got a splinter.
5,10,The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition,Sheldon,"Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, it’s “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,I believe that you’re capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,You want to hear something weird?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,What are you talking about?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Oh. I thought it was a game.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"There’s this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He’s in town and wants to have drinks."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Just do it, ’cause he’s not gonna let it go."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,And that’s how it’s done.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I don’t know.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"No, that was a different guy."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"No, that was a different, different guy."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,No.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"No, but, actually, that was this guy’s sister."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I don’t know.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I told you. That was a different guy.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,It’s two a.m. What are you doing up?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Look at these men. They’ve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Thanks.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"So, what’s got you up? Did you have a bad clam?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I didn’t have clams.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,I don’t watch you 24 hours a day. I don’t know what you do.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"It’s this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can’t decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What’s the matter, Saul? You afraid someone’s going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein’s cosmological constant?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I’m gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I’m hitting myself.”"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, now Perlmutter’s shaking the King’s hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,No.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"You know, I can really do this by myself."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"No, you’re not. You’re here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Scrotum.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Uh, stapled."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, hi."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,And there’s the first zinger. Ouch.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"I’m doing okay, I guess."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,The Newcomb medal.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That’s the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,My point.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Oh, I can’t take all the credit. You helped a lot."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Jimmy, I’m kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Technically, Howard’s the gear head. Leonard’s just a dime store laser jockey."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,What’s the idea?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Right.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I don’t think something like that’s even possible.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can’t live in fear of this man forever."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Sheldon, I got this."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"You clearly don’t. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you’re a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Sheldon.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you’re a mess."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I think what he’s trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey’s Kisses to your nipples.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,You really need to work on your penmanship.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,It wasn’t fun for me.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"You’re being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Come on, guys."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,I help the weak. It’s yet another way I’m exactly like Batman.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn’t the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Here’s your cocoa.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Yes.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Yes.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I’ll get it.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,What are you doing here?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Laxative.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Really?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Are you okay to drive?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"No, no, no, come on in. I’ll make you a cup of coffee."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,No.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Yes.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Sheldon, we can’t let him drive."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,You’d think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, just back there."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,You know what would be nice?
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who’ve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he’s asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn’t say we should do it."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,Leonard.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,Yeah.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,You’re soft. This world’s going to chew you up and spit you out.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Morning, Jimmy."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"Oh, there it is, tacos."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,"Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,That’s my French toast.
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Sheldon,"I’m not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
5,11,The Speckerman Recurrence,Leonard,I might kill him right now.
